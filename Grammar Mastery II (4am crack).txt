The error is a standard  ProDOS message, but it could easily  have been triggered manually after a  failed nibble check.Converting the disk to a standardformat will be tricky. Super Demuffinassumes all tracks share the sameprologue and epilogue bytes, but thisdisk's address prologue alternatesbetween "D5 AA 96" and "D4 AA 96".Advanced Demuffin requires a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS, but this disk uses ProDOS.Next steps:  1. Build an RWTS that can read the     original disk  2. Convert it to a standard format     with Advanced Demuffin  3. Patch the bootloader and/or the     PRODOS file to be able to read     a standard format disk  4. Find the nibble check (or whatever     is triggering the relocation error     on the EDD copy) and bypass it                   ~               Chapter 1      In Which We Learn That It's    All, Like, Just Ones And Zeroes[S6,D1=original disk (A-1)][S6,D2=blank disk][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5CAPTURING BOOT0...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0]BLOAD BOOT0,A$800]CALL -151*801L.. standard ProDOS bootloader, until....0831-   85 40       STA   $400833-   85 48       STA   $480835-   A0 63       LDY   #$630837-   B1 48       LDA   ($48),Y0839-   99 94 09    STA   $0994,Y083C-   C8          INY083D-   C0 EB       CPY   #$EB083F-   D0 F6       BNE   $08370841-   A2 06       LDX   #$060843-   BC 1D 09    LDY   $091D,X0846-   BD 24 09    LDA   $0924,X0849-   99 F2 09    STA   $09F2,Y084C-   BD 2B 09    LDA   $092B,X084F-   20 48 09    JSR   $0948    <- !0852-   CA          DEX0853-   10 EE       BPL   $0843Standard ProDOS does have this memorycopy loop at $0841..$0854, but it doesnot have any JSR in it.

This is how itcan fit an entire bootloader in threepages -- the hard part of reading thedisk is already taken care of.But on this disk, there is some extramassaging. For example, this snippetgets dropped into the middle of theRWTS code:095C-   4A          LSR095D-   C9 6A       CMP   #$6A095F-   D0 F3       BNE   $0954And this one:0961-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,X0964-   10 FB       BPL   $09610966-   C9 AA       CMP   #$AA0968-   D0 EA       BNE   $0954The upshot is that the final RWTS isdifferent than the drive controller ROMroutine. After all the memory massagingis complete, this is the part of theconstructed RWTS that checks for theaddress and data prologue:*9EFL09EF-   88          DEY09F0-   F0 F5       BEQ   $09E7; prologue nibble #109F2-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,X09F5-   10 FB       BPL   $09F209F7-   4A          LSR            |dif09F8-   C9 6A       CMP   #$6A     |fer09FA-   D0 F3       BNE   $09EF    |ent;

It doesn't evencare what the first epilogue byte was,as long as it wasn't $DE.This RWTS will accept two differentaddress prologues, "D5 AA 96" or "D4 AA96". It will also accept two differentaddress epilogues, "DE" or anything-other-than-DE-followed-by-a-timing-bit.Why didn't the EDD copy work?  The bootloader RWTS doesn't check  epilogue bytes at all, so it was able  to read the disk and load the PRODOS  file. Once control is transferred to  the PRODOS file, it switches to its  own RWTS to read the disk catalog and  find the first .SYSTEM file. But its  own RWTS can't read the disk, because  EDD preserved the original prologue  epilogue but not the timing bits.  The prologue checker (at $D398) finds  "D5 AA 96" even-numbered tracks) or  "D4 AA 96" (odd-numbered tracks). But  the epilogue checker's first compare  (at $D3EB) didn't match because the  first epilogue byte was still the  original value ($AF), and its second  compare (at $D3F4) didn't match  because there was no timing bit after  the first byte. ProDOS can't read the  disk catalog, so it displays the  "RELOCATION / CONFIGURATION ERROR"  and gives up. There was never any  nibble check; the very structure of  the disk itself is designed to foil  bit copiers.  Why did the demuffin'd copy work?  Advanced Demuffin wrote out the data  from each sector onto a standard disk  that uses "D5 AA 96" prologue and "DE  AA EB" epilogue. The bootloader RWTS  always matches "D5 AA 96" and doesn't  care that it never sees a "D4 AA 96",  and it never checks epilogue bytes at  all. The RWTS within the PRODOS file  always matches "D5 AA 96", and its  epilogue checker always matches "DE"  and never checks the timing bit. Thus  no RWTS patches are necessary.All 17 disks have identical protection.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 189------------------EOF------------------
