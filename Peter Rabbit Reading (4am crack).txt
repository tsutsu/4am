If it's too fast or too slow, itwill get out of phase (because the diskspins independently of the CPU).Compare DOS 3.3 (cycle count in margin)B94F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB952-   10 FB       BPL   $B94FB954-   C9 D5       CMP   #$D5    | 2B956-   D0 F0       BNE   $B948   | 2 *B958-   EA          NOP           | 2B959-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB95C-   10 FB       BPL   $B959(*) on the time-critical path, this    branch is not taken, so always 2...and this disk's RWTS:B94F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB952-   10 FB       BPL   $B94FB954-   4A          LSR           | 2B955-   C9 6A       CMP   #$6A    | 2B957-   D0 EF       BNE   $B948   | 2 *B959-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB95C-   10 FB       BPL   $B959Despite being more "flexible" (matching$D5 or $D4), this disk's RWTS uses thesame number of bytes of code and runsin the same number of cycles.

It doesn't evencare what the first epilogue byte was,as long as it wasn't $DE.This RWTS will accept two differentaddress prologues, "D5 AA 96" or "D4 AA96". It will also accept two differentaddress epilogues, "DE" or anything-other-than-DE-followed-by-a-timing-bit.Why didn't the EDD copy work?  EDD preserved the original prologue  epilogue but not the timing bits.  The prologue checker (at $B944) finds  "D5 AA 96" (even-numbered tracks) or  "D4 AA 96" (odd-numbered tracks). But  the epilogue checker's first compare  (at $B98B) didn't match because the  first epilogue byte was still the  original value ($AF), and its second  compare (at $B999) didn't match  because there was no timing bit after  the first byte. There was never any  separate nibble check; the structure  of the disk itself is designed to  foil nibble copiers.Why did the demuffin'd copy work?  Advanced Demuffin wrote out the data  from each sector onto a standard disk  that uses "D5 AA 96" prologue and "DE  AA EB" epilogue. The RWTS always  matches "D5 AA 96" and doesn't care  that it never sees a "D4 AA 96" for a  prologue. The epilogue checker always  matches "DE" and never checks the  timing bit. Thus, no RWTS patches are  necessary.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 289------------------EOF------------------
