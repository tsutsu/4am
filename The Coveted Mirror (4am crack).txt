To understandwhy, we need to look at the bits.A standard address prologue starts with$D5, and the even-numbered tracks usethis.In binary: $D5 = 1101 0101After LSR:       0110 1010 = $6ABut on this disk, the odd-numberedtracks have a custom address prologuethat starts with $D4 instead.In binary: $D4 = 1101 0100After LSR:       0110 1010 = $6ABy starting with the address prologueand munging it with LSR + EOR #$6A, thecode will match either $D5 or $D4.This allows the program disk (side B)to use any pattern of address prologues"D5 AA 96" or "D4 AA 96". They chose toalternate even and odd tracks, but thislow-level RWTS code doesn't care whattrack it's reading.But wait, it gets better. The gamewrites to side A for saved games. TheRWTS always writes an address prologueof "D5 AA 96". And that's OK, becausethe RWTS can read that too. There's nomagic to the specific pattern ofalternating address prologues on evenand odd tracks. The RWTS will accept"D5 AA 96" or "D4 AA 96" on any track.That means there's no need to switchmodes between "read a protected programdisk" and "read an unprotected datadisk." There's only one mode.Furthermore (and this is where thingsget really beautiful), RWTS code istime-critical between reading the lastbit of one nibble and reading the firstbit of the next. If it's too fast ortoo slow, it will get out of phase(because the disk spins independentlyof the CPU).Compare DOS 3.3 (cycle count in margin)B94F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB952-   10 FB       BPL   $B94FB954-   C9 D5       CMP   #$D5    | 2B956-   D0 F0       BNE   $B948   | 2 *B958-   EA          NOP           | 2B959-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB95C-   10 FB       BPL   $B959(*) on the time-critical path, this    branch is not taken, so always 2...and this disk's RWTS:B94F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB952-   10 FB       BPL   $B94FB954-   4A          LSR           | 2B955-   49 6A       EOR   #$6A    | 2B957-   D0 EF       BNE   $B948   | 2 *B959-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB95C-   10 FB       BPL   $B959Despite being more "flexible" (matching$D5 or $D4), this disk's RWTS uses thesame number of bytes of code and runsin the same number of cycles. Nice.Finally, this explains why I didn'tneed to patch the address prologue codeat $B954 and $B955 after AdvancedDemuffin converted the disk to astandard format. The cracked disk uses"D5 AA 96" on every track. The RWTSsees that, does its bit math, and says,"I'll allow it."---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 376------------------EOF------------------
