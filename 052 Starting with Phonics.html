    <p>"Starting with Phonics" is a 1983 educational program programmed by</p>
    <p>Clifford T. Schafer and published by</p>
    <p>K-12 MicroMedia.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails with a disk read error almost immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy just grinds endlessly.</p>
    <p>Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, it appears that sectors 0-9 on track 0 are encoded normally. Beyond that, things get weird. Pressing "P" to enter the Sector Editor Patcher, I select "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" to see if I can read the sector data by ignoring address and data epilogues. No such luck. But if I go further and select "CUSTOM", then turn off the checksum of the data field, I can read the sectors.</p>
    <p>But they're all garbage. Like they're encrypted or something.</p>
    <p>The original sounds like a DOS 3.3 boot (track $02 --> $01 --> $00 --> $11 &c.)</p>
    <p>But here's what Copy ][+ thinks is on T11,S0F:</p>

    <p>That... is not a disk catalog. Or is it? If you squint, it kind of looks like one. A short sequence of bytes in the $3x range, then a long string of $59. It feels like that *could* be an encrypted version of "HELLO" followed by spaces. Or maybe I'm just imagining it, seeing patterns where none exist.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the original disk boots and runs. This sector, if it is encrypted, has to get decrypted at some point.</p>
    <p>Let's see if I can use the original disk as a weapon against itself.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">

    </div>
    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format. (It uses the disk's own RWTS to read the original, then a standard DOS 3.3- compatible RWTS to write out the data, sector by sector.)</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, the disk's own RWTS can't read the boot1 code on track 0 (sectors 0-9), but that's OK. I captured that separately (in the "BOOT1" file), and I can replace it manually if I need to.</p>
    <p>Everything else appears to have gone as well as could be expected. The real question is... did it work? Was copying the disk with its own RWTS enough to decrypt the data? Or am I still left with garbage?</p>

    <p>Good news, everyone! The program loads and runs without complaint. All further disk access is done through standard DOS functions. (It even runs from drive 2.) There doesn't appear to be any kind of nibble check or other copy protection, beyond the custom RWTS.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now to make the disk be able to read itself (remember, it still has the original RWTS on it)...</p>
    <p>Using Copy ][+, I can "copy DOS" from a freshly initialized disk onto the demuffin'd copy. This function of Copy ][+ just sector-copies tracks 0-2 from one disk to another, but it's easier than setting that up manually in some other copy program.</p>
