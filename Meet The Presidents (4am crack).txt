The disk usesa custom bootloader to display theSoftsmith logo, so my AUTOTRACE scripton my work disk won't capture the RWTS.But luckily, the RWTS modifications areminor -- custom epilogue bytes, same onevery track -- so Super Demuffin willwork just fine.When you first run Super Demuffin, itasks for the parameters of the originaldisk. In this case, the prologue bytesare the same, but the epilogues are "FFFF EB" instead of "DE AA EB".                 --v--      SUPER-DEMUFFIN AND FAST COPYModified by: The Saltine/Coast to Coast   Address prologue: D5 AA 96   Address epilogue: FF FF EB    DISK                     ^^^^^     ORIGINAL             *change from "DE AA"      Data prologue: D5 AA AD      Data epilogue: FF FF EB                     ^^^^^             *change from "DE AA" Ignore write errors while demuffining!  D - Edit parameters      <SPACE> - Advance to next parm      <RETURN> - Exit edit mode  R - Restore DOS 3.3 parameters  O - Edit Original disk's parameters  C - Edit Copy disk's parameters  G - Begin demuffin process                 --^--Pressing "G" switches to the LocksmithFast Disk Copy UI. It assumes that bothdisks are in slot 6, and that drive 1is the original and drive 2 is thecopy.[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]                 --v--     LOCKSMITH 7.0  FAST DISK BACKUP   RR..................................   W***********************************HEX 00000000000000001111111111111111222TRK 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012   0A..................................   1...................................   2...................................   3...................................   4...................................   5...................................   6...................................   7...................................   8...................................   9...................................   A...................................   B...................................   C...................................   D...................................12 E...................................   F...................................[               ] PRESS [RESET] TO EXIT                 --^--Hmm, it copied everything except thevery first sector of the very firsttrack. There are only a few ways thatT00,S00 can be modified, because thethe disk controller ROM routine needsto be able to read it. That limits you,basically, to modified epilogue bytes.Perhaps it uses a different epiloguesequence, and I didn't notice in myinitial investigation?I'll copy it manually.[Disk Fixer]  ["O" -> "Input/Output Control"]    set "CHECKSUM ENABLED" to "NO"  [read track $00, sector $00]  ["C" to copy buffer to drive 2]OK.[S6,D1=demuffin'd copy]]PR#6...grinds...My demuffin'd copy can't read itselfyet. This is not unusual.                   ~               Chapter 2    In Which We Go RWTS SpelunkingThis disk uses a custom bootloader fromSoftsmith, which (judging by a cursoryexamination in a sector editor) takesup all of track $00 for its animatedtitle screen. But after that, it loadsa lightly modified DOS 3.3 (modulo theepilogue bytes) in the usual place inmemory, and the rest of the disk usesstandard DOS 3.3 commands.Turning once again to my trusty DiskFixer sector editor, I scanned for thehex sequence "BD 8C C0" ("LDA $C08C,X"is the customary way to read the datalatch and get a nibble from disk) andfound dozens of hits on track $02.At least some of the sectors on track$02 are loaded in reverse order into$B700..$BFFF:sector  | address--------+--------T02,S0F | $B700T02,S0E | $B800T02,S0D | $B900T02,S0C | $BA00T02,S0B | $BB00T02,S0A | $BC00T02,S09 | $BD00T02,S08 | $BE00T02,S07 | $BF00This is based solely on a visualinspection. You can compare the code onthese sectors to sectors $01-$09 ontrack $00 of a freshly formatted DOS3.3 disk -- it's nearly identical. It'scertainly "shaped" the same way.For future reference (mostly mine),here's a nice chart of the memorylocations for all the prologues andepilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS.                0x |  read | write    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B955 | $BC7A      prologue  AA | $B95F | $BC7F     /          96 | $B96A | $BC84    ADDRESS -------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B991 | $BCAE      epilogue  AA | $B99B | $BCB3                EB |       | $BCB8    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B8E7 | $B853      prologue  AA | $B8F1 | $B858     /          AD | $B8FC | $B85D    DATA ----------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B935 | $B89E      epilogue  AA | $B93F | $B8A3                EB |       | $B8A8    ---------------+-------+-------(2 epilogue bytes)  x (address + data)    x (read + write) = 8 patches total:T02,S0A,$AE change FF to DE     ; $BCAET02,S0A,$B3 change FF to AA     ; $BCB3T02,S0D,$35 change FF to DE     ; $B935T02,S0D,$3F change FF to AA     ; $B93FT02,S0D,$91 change FF to DE     ; $B991T02,S0D,$9B change FF to AA     ; $B99BT02,S0E,$9E change FF to DE     ; $B89ET02,S0E,$A3 change FF to AA     ; $B8A3All 4 disks use identical protection.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 316------------------EOF------------------
