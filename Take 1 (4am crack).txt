(EDD 4 bit copyfares no better.) It displays the twostrings "TAKE 1" and "06451" (a versionnumber, I think), then grinds the diskin a most unusual fashion (hopping backand forth between two tracks? trying toread a quarter track? I've never heardanything like it) until I franticallypower off in an attempt to save my 30year old floppy drive from marching offmy desk.Time for boot tracing, I suppose.[S6,D1=original disk][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5...CAPTURING BOOT0...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0]BLOAD BOOT0,A$800]CALL -151*801L; starts off looking like DOS 3.3 boot00801-   A5 27       LDA   $270803-   C9 09       CMP   #$090805-   D0 37       BNE   $083E0807-   A5 2B       LDA   $2B0809-   4A          LSR080A-   4A          LSR080B-   4A          LSR080C-   4A          LSR080D-   09 C0       ORA   #$C0080F-   85 3F       STA   $3F0811-   8D FE 08    STA   $08FE0814-   A9 5C       LDA   #$5C0816-   85 3E       STA   $3E0818-   18          CLC; slightly unusual -- it appears to; keep the target address and sector; count in $0869/A instead of $08FE/F0819-   AD 69 08    LDA   $0869081C-   6D 6A 08    ADC   $086A081F-   8D 69 08    STA   $0869; enable read/write on RAM bank 2 (at; $D000..$FFFF)0822-   AD 83 C0    LDA   $C0830825-   AD 83 C0    LDA   $C083; set low-level reset vector0828-   A9 F9       LDA   #$F9082A-   8D FC FF    STA   $FFFC082D-   8D FE FF    STA   $FFFE0830-   8D FA FF    STA   $FFFA0833-   A9 08       LDA   #$080835-   8D FD FF    STA   $FFFD0838-   8D FF FF    STA   $FFFF083B-   8D FB FF    STA   $FFFB; looks like a sector read loop083E-   AE 6A 08    LDX   $086A; jump out of the read loop here0841-   30 28       BMI   $086B0843-   BD 58 08    LDA   $0858,X0846-   85 3D       STA   $3D0848-   CE 6A 08    DEC   $086A084B-   AD 69 08    LDA   $0869084E-   85 27       STA   $270850-   CE 69 08    DEC   $08690853-   A6 2B       LDX   $2B; jump to disk controller ROM routine; to read sectors0855-   6C 3E 00    JMP   ($003E)...; looks like the loop above will read; 7 sectors into $DA00..$E0FF0869-   DA086A-   07; out of the sector read loop --; switch back to ROM, initialize; keyboard/video/text mode/screen086B-   AD 82 C0    LDA   $C082086E-   20 93 FE    JSR   $FE930871-   20 89 FE    JSR   $FE890874-   20 2F FB    JSR   $FB2F0877-   20 58 FC    JSR   $FC58; these two subroutines appear to copy; the title and version number to the; text page087A-   A0 00       LDY   #$00087C-   20 AC 08    JSR   $08AC087F-   C8          INY0880-   20 AC 08    JSR   $08AC; check for Applesoft in ROM, display; error message if not found0883-   AD 00 E0    LDA   $E0000886-   C9 4C       CMP   #$4C0888-   D0 13       BNE   $089D; switch back to RAM bank 2088A-   AD 83 C0    LDA   $C083088D-   AD 83 C0    LDA   $C083; push ($E000) to the stack, then; "return" to that address (+1)0890-   AD 00 E0    LDA   $E0000893-   C9 E0       CMP   #$E00895-   D0 06       BNE   $089D0897-   48          PHA0898-   AD 01 E0    LDA   $E001089B-   48          PHA089C-   60          RTSSince this boot0 code bears littleresemblance to DOS 3.3, I'll need acustom trace routine to capture thecode it loads into $DA00..$E0FF.*9600<C600.C6FFM; Interrupt boot at $086B, immediately; after the sector read loop.

It relies on tracks 0 and 1being synchronized on the physical diskin such a way that blindly jumpingbetween the tracks finds sectors in aspecific order as the disk is rotatingin the drive. It's theoreticallypossible to defeat this copy protectionwith a bit copy that maintains thatsynchronization (the so-called "synctracks" option in most copiers), buteven then it probably wouldn't work inan emulator. For example, the AppleWinemulator offers an "enhanced speed"option which ignores sector skew to getstandard DOS 3.3 disks to load faster.So even if I did manage to create aperfectly synchronized copy of thisdisk, emulators would just ignore it.Emulating copy protection is A HardProblem(tm).Anyway, this copy protection routinedoesn't seem to have any side effects.If it succeeds, execution continues at$E03A. If it fails, it keeps tryinguntil it succeeds (or until it destroysyour disk drive).Thus, I can change the jump address at$E000 to point to the first instructionafter the copy protection (minus 1, dueto how pushing addresses to the stackworks).T00,S06,$01 change "02" to "39"Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                      No. 69------------------EOF------------------
