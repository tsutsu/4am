Ifthe disk loads T00,S01 into $B700 (thisdoes), then $B800 will be in T00,S02;$B900 in T00,S03; and so on.                0x |  read | write    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B955 | $BC7A      prologue  AA | $B95F | $BC7F     /          96 | $B96A | $BC84    ADDRESS -------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B991 | $BCAE      epilogue  AA | $B99B | $BCB3                EB |       | $BCB8    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B8E7 | $B853      prologue  AA | $B8F1 | $B858     /          AD | $B8FC | $B85D    DATA ----------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B935 | $B89E      epilogue  AA | $B93F | $B8A3                EB |       | $B8A8    ---------------+-------+-------I spent way too much time making that.Anyway, here are the four patches thatallow my copy to read itself:T00,S03,$91 change AA to DET00,S03,$9B change DE to AAT00,S03,$35 change AA to DET00,S03,$3F change DE to AAQuod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 256------------------EOF------------------
