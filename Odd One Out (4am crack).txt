--------------Odd One Out--------------A 4am crack                  2014-04-08---------------------------------------Odd One Out is a 1986 educational gamedesigned by Donna Stanger, programmedby Paul Elseth & Lon Koenig, anddistributed by Sunburst Communications.The original disk is uncopyable byCOPYA or Locksmith Fast DiskBackup. EDD 4 bit copy gives no readerrors, but the copy just grinds a fewtimes and reboots.Some manual inspection with the Copy][+ nibble editor reveals that eachtrack has a different address and dataprologue:Track | Address  | Data------+----------+---------- $00  | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $01  | D5 AA 97 | D5 AA AE $02  | D5 AA 9A | D5 AA AF $03  | D5 AA 9B | D5 AA B2 $04  | D5 AA 9D | D5 AA B3And so on.Time for boot tracing with AUTOTRACE.[S5D1=my work disk][S6D1=original disk]]PR#5...CAPTURING BOOT0...boots slot 6......boots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0CAPTURING BOOT1...boots slot 6......boots slot 5...SAVING BOOT1SAVING RWTSWell, that worked flawlessly. My workdisk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which setsup a minimal boot trace to capture thefirst sector of track 0 and saves it tothe file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, notthe original disk). If the first sectorlooks reasonably normal, it runsAUTOTRACE1, which sets up a moreinvolved boot trace to capture the restof track 0 and save it to the file"BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonablynormal, it saves the RWTS to a file,unimaginatively named "RWTS", which canbe loaded with Advanced Demuffin tocopy each track of the original disk toa duplicate with standard address/dataprologue/epilogue sequences.Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTSfiles from a drive in slot 6, which isannoying since mine is in slot 5. Noteto self: patch that someday. In themeantime, I'm swapping floppy diskslike some kind of prehistoric caveman.[S6,D1=my work disk]]PR#6]BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1--> LOAD NEW RWTS MODULE    At $B8, load "RWTS"    from D1[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]--> FORMAT TARGET DISK...grind grind grind...--> CONVERT DISKThis disk is 16 sectors, and thedefault options (copy the entire disk,all tracks, all sectors) don't need tobe changed.ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1  - COPYRIGHT 1983WRITTEN BY THE STACK -CORRUPT COMPUTING=======PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE=======TRK:...................................+.5:    0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012SC0:...................................SC1:...................................SC2:...................................SC3:...................................SC4:...................................SC5:...................................SC6:...................................SC7:...................................SC8:...................................SC9:...................................SCA:...................................SCB:...................................SCC:...................................SCD:...................................SCE:...................................SCF:.................R.................=======================================16 SC $00,$00 TO $22,$0F BY $01 TO DRV2Hmm. The disk's own RWTS can't read onesingle sector on track $11? That'sodd. And T11,S0F is usually the firstsector of the VTOC, so this could befatal.Rebooting my work disk, I can see thedisk catalog on the demuffin'd copy,despite the read error on T11,S0F. Imake a mental note to investigate thislater.[S5D1=my work disk][S6D1=demuffin'd copy]]PR#5...]CATALOG,S6,D1C1983 DSR^C#254012 FREE*A 004 LOGO*B 002 RESTORE.OBJ*A 018 MENU*B 013 SUNBURST LOGO TABLE*A 046 ALIEN T 002 ALIEN FILE*B 002 CLEAREOL-SM.OBJ*B 002 CLEAR*T 003 MANSION ROOMS T 002 D-SAURUS FILE*A 022 TEACHER OPTION*A 038 DIGITOSAURUS T 002 HI SCORE MULTIPLICATION T 002 HI SCORE ADDITION*B 003 CMS4.OBJ*B 011 IMAGES1*B 002 BLINKER1.OBJ*A 032 MANSION*B 003 NUMBERS*B 007 BARRIER1*B 002 QUICKSOUND*B 002 XOR*B 003 ALIEN IMAGES2 T 002 HI SCORE SUBTRACTION*B 007 POINTERS T 002 HI SCORE DIVISION*B 017 MASTER-SM-MOD*B 033 GROUP5*B 033 PIC.MANSION2*B 031 GROUP4*B 031 GROUP2*B 033 PIC.OUTDOORS*B 031 GROUP1*B 033 GROUP3*B 008 MONSTER]RUN LOGOThe game loads and runs withoutcomplaint. All further disk access isdone through standard DOS functions.There don't appear to be any nibblechecks or any other form of secondaryprotection.Now to make the disk be able to readitself (remember, it still has theoriginal RWTS on it)...Using Copy ][+, I can "copy DOS" from afreshly initialized DOS 3.3 (orcompatible) disk onto the demuffin'dcopy. I actually chose ProntoDOS forthis purpose, since it's highlycompatible with standard DOS 3.3 butmuch faster. (This function of Copy ][+just sector-copies tracks 0-2 from onedisk to another, but it's easier thansetting that up manually in some othercopy program.)]PR#6...FILE NOT FOUNDOops, I forgot one last thing: theHELLO program is actually called LOGO.]PR#5...]CATALOG,S6,D1...]RENAME LOGO,HELLO]PR#6Quod erat liberandum.POSTSCRIPT: because you thought I'dforgotten about that unreadable sectoron track $11.Normally under DOS 3.3, track $11contains the VTOC. T11,S00 points toT11,S0F, which contains metadata (name,type, and a pointer to the track/sectorlist that contains pointers to theactual file data) about the first fewfiles that you see when you typeCATALOG. T11,S0F normally points toT11,S0E, which holds the same sort ofinformation on the next few files, andso on.But on the original disk, T11,S00points to T11,S0D instead, as shown inthis annotated screen capture from mytrusty Copy ][+ sector editor:SECTOR EDITOR                     DISK A00- A0 11 0D 03 00 00 FE 00   QMC@@~@       ^  ^track--+  +--sector08- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@10- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@18- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@20- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7A  @@@@@@@:28- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@30- 07 FF 00 00 23 10 00 01  G_@@#P@A38- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@40- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@48- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@50- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@58- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@60- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@68- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@70- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@78- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@80- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @@@@@@@@TRACK $11, SECTOR $0    DOS 3.3For whatever reason, the original copyprotection developer -- AFTER theychanged the prologue sequences on everysingle track to nonstandard values --decided that they weren't quite done,so they made a sector that even theirown custom RWTS couldn't read. And theychose the sector that normally kicksoff the disk catalog, justbecause... I'm not sure, exactly. OnceI ran the disk through AdvancedDemuffin, I had no problem catalogingthe disk from my work disk (which bootsDiversi-DOS). Maybe some other diskutilities are confused by a VTOC thatstarts on T11,S0D instead of T11,S0F.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                  2014-04-08-------------------EOF-----------------
