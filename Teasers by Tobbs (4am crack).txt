------------Teasers by Tobbs-----------A 4am crack                  2014-05-18---------------------------------------"Teasers by Tobbs: Puzzles and ProblemSolving" is a 1982 educational gameauthored by Tom O'Brien and distributedby Sunburst Communications, Inc.[The copy protection is identical to"FOR Your NEXT Adventure," alsodistributed by Sunburst. This write-upis therefore quite similar to that one,with a few corrections.]The original disk is uncopyable byCOPYA or Locksmith Fast Disk Backup.EDD 4 bit copy gives read errors ontracks $13 and up. Oddly, when I lookat the original disk with the Copy ][+nibble editor, those "unreadable"tracks do appear to be formatted and tocontain data. Needless to say, the copydoes not work.Further inspection in the nibble editorreveals that each track has a differentaddress and data prologue:Track | Address  | Data------+----------+---------- $00  | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD (normal) $01  | D5 AA 97 | D5 AA AE $02  | D5 AA 9A | D5 AA AF $03  | D5 AA 9B | D5 AA B2 $04  | D5 AA 9D | D5 AA B3And so on.Time for boot tracing with AUTOTRACE.[S6D1=original disk][S5D1=my work disk]]PR#5...CAPTURING BOOT0...boots slot 6......boots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0CAPTURING BOOT1...boots slot 6......boots slot 5...SAVING BOOT1SAVING RWTSWell, that worked flawlessly. My workdisk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which setsup a minimal boot trace to capture thefirst sector of track 0 and saves it tothe file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, notthe original disk). If the first sectorlooks reasonably normal, it runsAUTOTRACE1, which sets up a moreinvolved boot trace to capture the restof track 0 and save it to the file"BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonablynormal, it saves the RWTS to a file,unimaginatively named "RWTS", which canbe loaded with Advanced Demuffin tocopy each track of the original disk toa duplicate with standard address/dataprologue/epilogue sequences.Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTSfiles from a drive in slot 6, which isannoying since mine is in slot 5. Noteto self: patch that someday. In themeantime, I'm swapping floppy diskslike some kind of 20th century peasant.[S6,D1=my work disk]]PR#6]BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1--> LOAD NEW RWTS MODULE    At $B8, load "RWTS"    from drive 1[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]--> FORMAT TARGET DISK...grind grind grind...--> CONVERT DISKThis disk is 16 sectors, and thedefault options (copy the entire disk,all tracks, all sectors) don't need tobe changed.ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1  - COPYRIGHT 1983WRITTEN BY THE STACK -CORRUPT COMPUTING=======PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE=======TRK:...................................+.5:    0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012SC0:...................................SC1:...................................SC2:...................................SC3:...................................SC4:...................................SC5:...................................SC6:...................................SC7:...................................SC8:...................................SC9:...................................SCA:...................................SCB:...................................SCC:...................................SCD:...................................SCE:...................................SCF:...................................=======================================16 SC $00,$00 TO $22,$0F BY $01 TO DRV2The disk's own RWTS gave no read errorson any track. (EDD 4 bit copy gave awhole slew of read errors.)  Whateverweird prologue sequences the originaldisk is using, it managed to confuseEDD 4. Impressive, in a twisted kind ofway. But it shows the power and thegenius of Advanced Demuffin. Every diskmust be able to read itself. So, let itread itself, then capture the data andwrite it out in a standard format.Rebooting my work disk, I can now seethe catalog on the demuffin'd copy.[S6D1=demuffin'd copy][S5D1=my work disk]]PR#5...]CATALOG,S6,D1C1983 DSR^C#254262 FREE A 004 LOGO*B 013 SUNBURST LOGO TABLE A 051 TOBBS1 A 017 MENU*A 018 INSTRUCTIONS FOR TOBBS2*B 016 IMAGES1*B 018 MASTER-MD*B 017 MASTER-SM*B 002 CLEAREOL-SM.OBJ*B 002 CLEAREOL-MD.OBJ*B 015 IMAGES2*B 002 CMS3.OBJ*B 014 PUZZLE A 045 TOBBS2]RUN LOGOThe game loads and runs withoutcomplaint. All further disk access isdone through standard DOS functions.There doesn't appear to be any kind ofnibble check or other copy protection,beyond the custom RWTS.Now to make the disk be able to readitself (remember, it still has theoriginal RWTS on it)...Using Copy ][+, I can "copy DOS" from afreshly initialized DOS 3.3 disk ontothe demuffin'd copy. This function ofCopy ][+ just sector-copies tracks 0-2from one disk to another, but it'seasier than setting that up manually insome other copy program.Copy ][+  --> COPY    --> DOS      --> from slot 6, drive 2      -->   to slot 6, drive 1[S6D1=demuffin'd copy][S6D2=newly formatted DOS 3.3 disk]...read read read......write write write...And finally, I need to change the bootprogram to "LOGO".  This feature ofCopy ][+ just presents a list interfaceto choose a file from the catalog, thensector-edits track 1, sector 9 to setthe name of the program that DOS runs(instead of "HELLO").Copy ][+  --> CHANGE BOOT PROGRAM    --> on slot 6, drive 1      --> LOGOQuod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                      No. 38------------------EOF------------------
