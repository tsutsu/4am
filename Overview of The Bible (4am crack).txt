The original disk has two addressfields for T00,S00. One of them is thestart of the actual sector data. Theother one is a decoy that has anaddress field but no data field. Theraw nibbles immediately following thetwo address prologues are different,and this routine checks to ensure thatthey are different.The routine in the disk controller ROM(usually at $C65C) that looks for track0 sector 0 will ignore the decoy if ithappens to find it before the real one.(Technically, it will look for the datafield, not find it in a reasonable timeframe, and start over, and eventuallyit will find the real address field asthe disk continues to spin.) This decoyis apparently enough to fool bit copyprograms.This is all very interesting -- and itexplains why my bit copy would justhang during boot -- but it doesn't getme any closer to understanding thisdisk's custom RWTS.Let's back up.                   ~               Chapter 3     On The Seventh Day He RWTSed*B793LB793-   4C 00 B8    JMP   $B800B796-   AD E4 B7    LDA   $B7E4B799-   20 B5 B7    JSR   $B7B5Ignoring the JMP for the moment, themulti-sector read routine calls thestandard $B7B5 entry point to actuallyread a single sector.*B7B5L; this is normalB7B5-   08          PHPB7B6-   78          SEI; definitely not normal (usually $BD00)B7B7-   20 00 BA    JSR   $BA00; the rest is all normalB7BA-   B0 03       BCS   $B7BFB7BC-   28          PLPB7BD-   18          CLCB7BE-   60          RTSB7BF-   28          PLPB7C0-   38          SECB7C1-   60          RTSThat explains why I couldn't find theRWTS code I expected in the location Iexpected. This RWTS is laid outcompletely differently in memory thanthe standard DOS 3.3 RWTS. Even theentry point is different ($BA00 insteadof $BD00).*BA00LBA00-   85 48       STA   $48BA02-   84 49       STY   $49BA04-   A0 02       LDY   #$02BA06-   8C F8 06    STY   $06F8BA09-   A0 04       LDY   #$04BA0B-   8C F8 04    STY   $04F8BA0E-   A0 01       LDY   #$01BA10-   B1 48       LDA   ($48),YBA12-   AA          TAXBA13-   A0 0F       LDY   #$0FBA15-   D1 48       CMP   ($48),YBA17-   F0 1B       BEQ   $BA34Yup, that looks like an RWTS entrypoint.Oh, and remember that weird code at$B6F0 that set two zero page locationsfor no apparent reason? Here's thereason: the RWTS uses them. (I've seenthis pattern before, too.) Afterseconds of furious investigation, Ifound the RWTS code that looks for thedata prologue:*BDE1LBDE1-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XBDE4-   10 FB       BPL   $BDE1BDE6-   49 D5       EOR   #$D5BDE8-   D0 F4       BNE   $BDDEBDEA-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XBDED-   10 FB       BPL   $BDEABDEF-   C5 31       CMP   $31     <-- !BDF1-   D0 F3       BNE   $BDE6BDF3-   A0 56       LDY   #$56BDF5-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XBDF8-   10 FB       BPL   $BDF5BDFA-   C5 4E       CMP   $4E     <-- !BDFC-   D0 E8       BNE   $BDE6And there it is, in living color: thisRWTS uses two magic zero page values tofind the data prologue while it'sreading a sector from disk.Why? Because f--- you, that's why.Because it makes the extracted RWTSuseless without initializing the magiczero page location with the right magicnumber. Automated RWTS extractionprograms wouldn't find this. If I loadthis RWTS into Advanced Demuffin, itwill not be able to read the originaldisk, because the RWTS itself is notwhat initializes the magic zero pagelocation.I can save this RWTS into a separatefile, but I won't be able to use it inAdvanced Demuffin without an IOBmodule. See the Advanced Demuffindocumentation on my work disk for allthe gory details about IOB modules.Basically, Advanced Demuffin only knowshow to call a custom RWTS if it1. is loaded at $B800..$BFFF2. uses a standard RWTS parameter table3. has an entry point at $BD00 that   takes the address of the parameter   tables in A and Y4. doesn't require initializationAs it turns out, that covers a *lot* ofcopy protected disks, but it doesn'tcover this one. This disk failsassumption #3 (the entry point is at$BA00, not $BD00) and #4 (the RWTSrelies on the values of zero page $31and $4E, which are initialized outsidethe RWTS).So, let's make an IOB module.; Most of this is identical to the; standard IOB module that comes with; Advanced Demuffin1400-   4A          LSR1401-   8D 22 0F    STA   $0F221404-   8C 23 0F    STY   $0F231407-   8E 27 0F    STX   $0F27140A-   A9 01       LDA   #$01140C-   8D 20 0F    STA   $0F20140F-   8D 2A 0F    STA   $0F2A; initialize the magic zero page values1412-   A9 AA       LDA   #$AA1414-   85 31       STA   $311416-   A9 AD       LDA   #$AD1418-   85 4E       STA   $4E; get the address of the RWTS parameter; table at $0F1E and call the RWTS at; its non-standard entry point, $BA00141A-   A9 0F       LDA   #$0F141C-   A0 1E       LDY   #$1E141E-   4C 00 BA    JMP   $BA00Wait wait wait... I've made thismistake before. This IOB module won'twork. Advanced Demuffin will crash.Learn from your mistakes so you havethe opportunity to make interesting newones.I'll explain. Let's back up.*B793LB793-   4C 00 B8    JMP   $B800B796-   AD E4 B7    LDA   $B7E4B799-   20 B5 B7    JSR   $B7B5That "JMP $B800" instruction getsreplaced immediately at $B800.B800-   A9 AC       LDA   #$ACB802-   8D 93 B7    STA   $B793B805-   A9 E5       LDA   #$E5B807-   8D 94 B7    STA   $B794B80A-   A9 B7       LDA   #$B7B80C-   8D 95 B7    STA   $B795So, the routine at $B793 ends uplooking like this:B793-   AC E5 B7    LDY   $B7E5B796-   AD E4 B7    LDA   $B7E4B799-   20 B5 B7    JSR   $B7B5Perfectly ordinary, no? Actually, no.Here's what it looks like on anordinary (unprotected) DOS 3.3 disk.B793-   AD E5 B7    LDA   $B7E5B796-   AC E4 B7    LDY   $B7E4B799-   20 B5 B7    JSR   $B7B5Spot the difference. Go ahead, I'llwait.A and Y get passed through to the RWTSentry point, which is usually at $BD00but on this disk is at $BA00.DOS 3.3 disk:*BD00LBD00-   84 48       STY   $48BD02-   85 49       STA   $49This disk:*BA00LBA00-   85 48       STA   $48BA02-   84 49       STY   $49Now do you see it? On a normal disk,the Y register holds the low byte ofthe RWTS parameter table address, andthe accumulator holds the high byte.But on this disk, those are reversed;the accumulator holds the low byte, andthe Y register holds the high byte.Why? Because f--- you, that's why.Of course, the IOB module I created tointerface with this RWTS was stillputting the low byte in Y and the highbyte in A, so the RWTS was reading acompletely bogus parameter table andGod only knows what happened next.(Thank goodness the original disk waswrite-protected.)I need to make one little change to myIOB module.1400-   4A          LSR1401-   8D 22 0F    STA   $0F221404-   8C 23 0F    STY   $0F231407-   8E 27 0F    STX   $0F27140A-   A9 01       LDA   #$01140C-   8D 20 0F    STA   $0F20140F-   8D 2A 0F    STA   $0F2A1412-   A9 AA       LDA   #$AA1414-   85 31       STA   $311416-   A9 AD       LDA   #$AD1418-   85 4E       STA   $4E141A-   A0 0F       LDY   #$0F ; Y=high141C-   A9 1E       LDA   #$1E ; A=low141E-   4C 00 BA    JMP   $BA00*BSAVE IOB,A$1400,L$FBNow let's go.*BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.5[press "5" to switch to slot 5][press "R" to load a new RWTS module]  --> At $B6, load "BOOT1" from drive 1[press "I" to load a new IOB module]  --> load "IOB" from drive 1[press "6" to switch to slot 6][press "C" to convert disk]                 --v--ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.5    (C) 1983, 2014ORIGINAL BY THE STACK    UPDATES BY 4AM=======================================TRK:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR+.5:    0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012SC0:...RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC1:...RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC2:...RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC3:...RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC4:...RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC5:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC6:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC7:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC8:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC9:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCA:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCB:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCC:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCD:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCE:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCF:..RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR=======================================16SC $00,$00-$22,$0F BY1.0 S6,D1->S6,D2                 --^--Make no mistake: this is definitelyprogress.
