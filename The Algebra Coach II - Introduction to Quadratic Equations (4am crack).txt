Either it's calling DOSvectors directly (outside of page 3),or it's using the language card forsomething and doesn't realize thatDiversi-DOS has already relocateditself there.But it works when booted from standardDOS 3.3, which is good. The reason I dothis is to check whether there are anyruntime checks for subtle differencesin the original DOS. If the programruns after booting from a third-partydisk, I can eliminate a whole range ofpossible secondary protections.[S6,D1=demuffin'd copy]]PR#6...grinds...My copy can't read itself yet.
