----Rabbits, Robots, and a Monkey 1----A 4am crack                  2014-06-03---------------------------------------"Rabbits, Robots, and a Monkey 1" is a1990 educational program distributed byHartley Courseware, Inc., with lessoncontent by Janet Goldman. It comes onfive disks; the first three disks aresingle-sided, but the last two aredouble-sided.[The copy protection is identical to"Tim and the Cat and The Big Red Hat,"also distributed by Hartley Courseware.This write-up is therefore quitesimilar to that one, with a few minorcorrections.]COPYA fails immediately with a diskread error on the first three disks.EDD 4 bit copy gives no errors, and thecopies work (each disk is bootable),which suggests that these disks may notuse any secondary protection beyond thenon-standard disk structure. (I haveseen some weaker nibble checks that canbe defeated with a strong bit copier,so you never know until you try.)Disks 4 and 5 are entirely different.They boot ProDOS instead of DOS 3.3,and they copy successfully with COPYA.They are also double-sided, althoughonly the first side of each isbootable. I swear the original diskswere labeled as "disk 4" and "disk 5"of "Rabbits, Robots, and a Monkey 1",otherwise I would never believe theywere part of the same set.Turning back to disk 1 and firing up mytrusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press"P" to get to the Sector Editor Patcherand select "DOS 3.3 PATCHED". Thisoption ignores checksum bytes andepilogue sequences.  As long as theaddress and data prologue are standard("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD",respectively), this will allow me toread each sector. And lo and behold, itworks! I can read the data from everysector on every track.The Copy ][+ nibble editor also showsstandard address and data prologues,but an address epilogue of DA AA FF anda data epilogue of DA AA EB. (Thestandard epilogues are "DE AA EB" forboth.)                 --v--   COPY ][ PLUS BIT COPY PROGRAM 8.4(C) 1982-9 CENTRAL POINT SOFTWARE, INC.---------------------------------------TRACK: 03  START: 2BFC  LENGTH: 015F2BD8: 9A 96 D6 96 96 D6 9E A6   VIEW2BE0: 9A D6 96 96 96 D6 9D 9D2BE8: 96 D6 96 96 96 D6 9D DB2BF0: DA AA EB FF FF FF FF FF      ^^^^^^^^   data epilogue (of previous sector)2BF8: FF FF FF FF D5 AA 96 AA  <-2BFC                  ^^^^^^^^              address prologue2C00: AB AB AB AA AA AB AA DA                           ^^--+                               |2C08: AA FF FF FF FF FF FF FF  |      ^^^^^                    | address epilogue -------------+2C10: D5 AA AD 9B AE BD B9 B9      ^^^^^^^^   data prologue2C18: B9 AC BF F3 DF CE BB BF---------------------------------------  A  TO ANALYZE DATA  ESC TO QUIT  ?

I could probablyuse COPYA with the $B942:18 patch tocopy these disks, but instead I'm goingto try another utility that I justlearned about: Super Demuffin.Super Demuffin is a cracker's utilitybuilt on top of Locksmith Fast DiskCopy. It takes a disk that uses non-standard but uniform address and dataprologue and epilogue bytes, and itconverts it to a standard disk format.I've included a copy on my work disk.When you first run Super Demuffin, itasks for the parameters of the originaldisk. In this case, the prologue bytesare the same, but the epilogues use"DA" instead of "DE". I just need tochange those two parameters (shownbelow). The third byte of the addressepilogue is not important, since mostDOS 3.3-shaped RWTSes ignore it.                 --v--      SUPER-DEMUFFIN AND FAST COPYModified by: The Saltine/Coast to Coast   Address prologue: D5 AA 96   Address epilogue: DA AA EB    DISK                     ^^        ORIGINAL*change from "DE" ---++      Data prologue: D5 AA AD      Data epilogue: DA AA EB                     ^^*change from "DE" ---++ Ignore write errors while demuffining!  D - Edit parameters      <SPACE> - Advance to next parm      <RETURN> - Exit edit mode  R - Restore DOS 3.3 parameters  O - Edit Original disk's parameters  C - Edit Copy disk's parameters  G - Begin demuffin process                 --^--Pressing "G" switches to the LocksmithFast Disk Copy UI. It assumes that bothdisks are in slot 6, and that drive 1is the original and drive 2 is thecopy.[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]                 --v--     LOCKSMITH 7.0  FAST DISK BACKUP   R...................................   W***********************************HEX 00000000000000001111111111111111222TRK 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012   0...................................   1...................................   2...................................   3...................................   4...................................   5...................................   6...................................   7...................................   8...................................   9...................................   A...................................   B...................................   C...................................   D...................................12 E...................................   F...................................[               ] PRESS [RESET] TO EXIT                 --^--(I do this for each of the first threedisks.)This gives me copies in a standard diskformat, but I still need to modify theRWTS on each disk to look for the (nowstandard) epilogue bytes. Switching tomy trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, Isearch for the hex byte "DA" and findall four instances (address epilogueread and write, data epilogue read andwrite).For future reference (mostly mine),here's a nice chart of the memorylocations for all the prologues andepilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. Ifthe RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (mostdo), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02;$B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.                0x |  read | write    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B955 | $BC7A      prologue  AA | $B95F | $BC7F     /          96 | $B96A | $BC84    ADDRESS -------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B991 | $BCAE      epilogue  AA | $B99B | $BCB3                EB |       | $BCB8    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B8E7 | $B853      prologue  AA | $B8F1 | $B858     /          AD | $B8FC | $B85D    DATA ----------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B935 | $B89E      epilogue  AA | $B93F | $B8A3                EB |       | $B8A8    ---------------+-------+-------I spent way too much time making that.Anyway, here are the four patches thatallow my copy to read itself. (Thesepatches apply to each of the firstthree disks.)T00,S02,$9E change "DA" to "DE"T00,S03,$35 change "DA" to "DE"T00,S03,$91 change "DA" to "DE"T00,S06,$AE change "DA" to "DE"Success! Each disk boots and loads withno complaint. There doesn't appear tobe any secondary protection.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                      No. 61------------------EOF------------------
