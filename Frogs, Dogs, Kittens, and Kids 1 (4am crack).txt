----Frogs, Dogs, Kittens, and Kids 1---A 4am crack                  2014-06-03---------------------------------------"Frogs, Dogs, Kittens, and Kids 1" is a1988 educational program by JanetGoldman and distributed by HartleyCourseware, Inc. It comes on threedisks, each bootable.[The copy protection is identical to"Tim and the Cat and The Big Red Hat,"also distributed by Hartley Courseware.This write-up is therefore quitesimilar to that one, with a few minorcorrections.]COPYA fails immediately with a diskread error. EDD 4 bit copy gives noerrors, and the copy works, whichsuggests that this disk many not useany secondary protection beyond thenon-standard disk structure. (I haveseem some weaker nibble checks that canbe defeated with a strong bit copier,so you never know until you try.)Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sectoreditor, I press "P" to get to theSector Editor Patcher, and select "DOS3.3 PATCHED". This option ignoreschecksum bytes and epilogue sequences.As long as the address and dataprologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and"D5 AA AD", respectively), this willallow me to read each sector. And loand behold, it works! I can read thedata from every sector on every track.The Copy ][+ nibble editor also showsstandard address and data prologues,but an address epilogue of DA AA FF anda data epilogue of DA AA EB. (Thestandard epilogues are "DE AA EB" forboth.)                 --v--   COPY ][ PLUS BIT COPY PROGRAM 8.4(C) 1982-9 CENTRAL POINT SOFTWARE, INC.---------------------------------------TRACK: 03  START: 25B5  LENGTH: 015F2590: 9A 9B 97 97 96 97 97 9B   VIEW2598: 9A 97 9A 9B 97 9D 9E 9B25A0: 9E 9F 9F 9B 9E A6 9B 9D25A8: DF DA AA EB FF FF FF FF         ^^^^^^^^      data epilogue (previous sector)25B0: FF FF FF FF FF D5 AA 96  <-25B5                     ^^^^^^^^                 address prologue25B8: AA AB AB AB AA AA AB AA25C0: DA AA FF FF FF FF FF FF      ^^^^^^^^  address epilogue25C8: FF D5 AA AD F2 F3 E6 FB         ^^^^^^^^      data prologue25D0: CF FB FE D9 D6 96 FC ED---------------------------------------  A  TO ANALYZE DATA  ESC TO QUIT  ?

I could probably use COPYA withthe $B942:18 patch to copy these disks,but instead I'm going to try anotherutility that I just learned about:Super Demuffin.Super Demuffin is a cracker's utilitybuilt on top of Locksmith Fast DiskCopy. It takes a disk that uses non-standard but uniform address and dataprologue and epilogue bytes, and itconverts it to a standard disk format.I've included a copy on my work disk.When you first run Super Demuffin, itasks for the parameters of the originaldisk. In this case, the prologue bytesare the same, but the epilogues use"DA" instead of "DE". I just need tochange those two parameters (shownbelow). The third byte of the addressepilogue is not important, since mostDOS 3.3-shaped RWTSes ignore it.                 --v--      SUPER-DEMUFFIN AND FAST COPYModified by: The Saltine/Coast to Coast   Address prologue: D5 AA 96   Address epilogue: DA AA EB    DISK                     ^^        ORIGINAL*change from "DE" ---++      Data prologue: D5 AA AD      Data epilogue: DA AA EB                     ^^*change from "DE" ---++ Ignore write errors while demuffining!  D - Edit parameters      <SPACE> - Advance to next parm      <RETURN> - Exit edit mode  R - Restore DOS 3.3 parameters  O - Edit Original disk's parameters  C - Edit Copy disk's parameters  G - Begin demuffin process                 --^--Pressing "G" switches to the LocksmithFast Disk Copy UI. It assumes that bothdisks are in slot 6, and that drive 1is the original and drive 2 is thecopy.[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]                 --v--     LOCKSMITH 7.0  FAST DISK BACKUP   R...................................   W***********************************HEX 00000000000000001111111111111111222TRK 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012   0...................................   1...................................   2...................................   3...................................   4...................................   5...................................   6...................................   7...................................   8...................................   9...................................   A...................................   B...................................   C...................................   D...................................12 E...................................   F...................................[               ] PRESS [RESET] TO EXIT                 --^--(I do this for all three disks.)This gives me copies in a standard diskformat, but I still need to modify theRWTS on disk to look for the (nowstandard) epilogue bytes. Switching tomy trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, Isearch for the hex byte "DA" and findall four instances (address epilogueread and write, data epilogue read andwrite).For future reference (mostly mine),here's a nice chart of the memorylocations for all the prologues andepilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. Ifthe RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (mostdo), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02;$B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.                0x |  read | write    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B955 | $BC7A      prologue  AA | $B95F | $BC7F     /          96 | $B96A | $BC84    ADDRESS -------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B991 | $BCAE      epilogue  AA | $B99B | $BCB3                EB |       | $BCB8    ---------------+-------+-------                D5 | $B8E7 | $B853      prologue  AA | $B8F1 | $B858     /          AD | $B8FC | $B85D    DATA ----------+-------+-------     \          DE | $B935 | $B89E      epilogue  AA | $B93F | $B8A3                EB |       | $B8A8    ---------------+-------+-------I spent way too much time making that.Anyway, here are the four patches thatallow my copies to read themselves.(These patches apply to each disk.)T00,S02,$9E change "DA" to "DE"T00,S03,$35 change "DA" to "DE"T00,S03,$91 change "DA" to "DE"T00,S06,$AE change "DA" to "DE"Success! All disks boot and load withno complaint. There doesn't appear tobe any secondary protection.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                      No. 60------------------EOF------------------
