The disk isProDOS-based, so my AUTOTRACE scripton my work disk won't capture the RWTS.But luckily, the RWTS modifications areminor -- custom epilogue bytes, same onevery track -- so Super Demuffin willwork just fine.When you first run Super Demuffin, itasks for the parameters of the originaldisk. In this case, the prologue bytesare the same, but the epilogues are "EBAA EB" instead of "DE AA EB".                 --v--      SUPER-DEMUFFIN AND FAST COPYModified by: The Saltine/Coast to Coast   Address prologue: D5 AA 96   Address epilogue: DE AA EB    DISK                               ORIGINAL      Data prologue: D5 AA AD      Data epilogue: EB AA EB                     ^^             *change from "DE" Ignore write errors while demuffining!  D - Edit parameters      <SPACE> - Advance to next parm      <RETURN> - Exit edit mode  R - Restore DOS 3.3 parameters  O - Edit Original disk's parameters  C - Edit Copy disk's parameters  G - Begin demuffin process                 --^--Pressing "G" switches to the LocksmithFast Disk Copy UI. It assumes that bothdisks are in slot 6, and that drive 1is the original and drive 2 is thecopy.[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]                 --v--     LOCKSMITH 7.0  FAST DISK BACKUP   R...................................   W***********************************HEX 00000000000000001111111111111111222TRK 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012   0...................................   1...................................   2...................................   3...................................   4...................................   5...................................   6...................................   7...................................   8...................................   9...................................   A...................................   B...................................   C...................................   D...................................12 E...................................   F...................................[               ] PRESS [RESET] TO EXIT                 --^--[S7,D1=ProDOS hard drive]]PR#7...]CAT,S6,D1/BS NAME           TYPE  BLOCKS  MODIFIED PRODOS          SYS      30  14-MAY-87 PICS            DIR       1  14-MAY-87 ANM.SUBS        BIN       5  14-MAY-87 BOARS.SYSTEM    SYS       5  14-MAY-87 MISC.SUBS       BIN       8  14-MAY-87 OPENING         BIN       7  14-MAY-87 CHSET           BIN       3  14-MAY-87BLOCKS FREE:  167     BLOCKS USED:  113]PREFIX /BS]-BOARS.SYSTEM...works...                   ~               Chapter 2    In Which Our Adventure Comes To  A Sudden But Satisfying ConclusionDepending on how the original disk waswritten, this copy may or may not beable to read itself.
