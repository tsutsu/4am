    <p>"Professor Davensteev's Fantasy Land (Red Level)" is a 1983 educational game. The title pages gives copyright to two companies: Learning Well of</p>
    <p>Roslyn Heights, NY, and Methods &</p>
    <p>Solutions of Woburn, MA. According to online sources, there was also a "Blue</p>
    <p>Level" distributed separately, but I only have this one.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails miserably and immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy gives no errors, and the copy works, which suggests that this disk may not use any secondary protection beyond the non-standard disk structure. (I have seen some weaker nibble checks that can be defeated with a strong bit copier, so you never know until you try.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Sector Editor Patcher, and select "DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 PATCHED". This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p class="seen">As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p>Track $11 appears to be a standard DOS</p>
    <p>3.3 disk catalog. T01,S09 lists HELLO as the autorun program.</p>
    <p>Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p>3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p>These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p>The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p>It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p>So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p>Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format.</p>
    <p>Based on my initial inspection with a sector editor, this disk loads DOS and runs a HELLO program. So it shouldn't be difficult to capture the RWTS and load it into Advanced Demuffin.</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, that worked flawlessly. My work disk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which sets up a minimal boot trace to capture the first sector of track 0 and saves it to the file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, not the original disk). If the first sector looks reasonably normal, it runs AUTOTRACE1, which sets up a more involved boot trace to capture the rest of track 0 and save it to the file "BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonably normal, it saves the RWTS to a file, unimaginatively named "RWTS", which can be loaded with Advanced Demuffin to copy each track of the original disk to a duplicate with standard address/data prologue/epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot 5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppies like some kind of 20th century teenager.</p>

    <p>This disk uses a DOS 3.3 "master" RWTS that is loaded into low memory ($1B00.. $3FFF), then relocated into a "normal" location ($9B00..$BFFF) later. This was a hack that dates back to the time when developers couldn't rely on an Apple II having 48K of memory. Talk about backward compatibility!</p>
    <p>It also explains why Advanced Demuffin crashed. I loaded the "RWTS" file at $B800, but the RWTS wants to be loaded at $3800. This calls for an IOB module.</p>
    <p>What's an IOB module? Quoting from the</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin documentation (which</p>
    <p>I've included on my work disk):</p>
    <div class="curses">
      <code>An IOB module is an interface for the
source RWTS. Advanced Demuffin uses the
IOB module to set up the IOB table and
jump to RWTS.  The IOB module is stored
from $1400-$14FB. When Advanced
Demuffin loads in a IOB module, it
reads the first sector of the file off
the track-sector list and stores it at
$13FC-$14FB. When Advanced Demuffin
wants to read a sector it JSRs to the
IOB module with the phase number,
sector number, and the page number
stored in the A, Y and X registers
respectively. Since the source drive
always has to be drive one, Advanced
Demuffin can make the IOB module very
compact. After it gets the page,track
and sector Advanced Demuffin sets up
the IOB for RWTS using this infor-
mation, and JMPs to RWTS. (It jumps
instead of JSRing, because it lets the
RWTS do the RTS.) Here is a list of the
IOB module that is built in to Advanced
Demuffin:</code>

      <p class="comment">One problem with having an RWTS at $3800..$3FFF is that that range is normally used to store track data during the copy process. If we just let Advanced Demuffin run, it will overwrite the custom RWTS almost immediately and crash (again). In the ADVANCED DEMUFFIN TECH NOTES (also included on my work disk), the author mentions that you can control how many sectors Advanced Demuffin reads at a time, and where it puts it in memory. Normally $1CF0 is $20 and $1CF1 is $90, meaning that it will copy 7 tracks worth of data at a time into $2000..$8FFF. Changing the end parameter to $30 will only copy one track at a time, but has the distinct advantage of not overwriting the RWTS and crashing.</p>
