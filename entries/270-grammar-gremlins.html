  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <h3>P-Code Is Best Code</h3>

    <p>The numbers along the left of the disassembly are byte offsets in decimal, not hex. It looks like the numbers along the right are also in decimal, but the opcodes are in hex.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   0: B9 2A               UJP    42</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to Appendix A in the "Apple</p>
    <p class="seen">Pascal Operating System Reference</p>
    <p>Manual" (hereafter known as "the f---ing manual"), "UJP" stands for "unconditional jump." With a positive parameter, it functions like a relative forward jump, similar to branch opcodes in 6502 assembly. The offset is added to the PC of the next instruction, not the current one. (Assembly language branches also work this way.) In other words, this two-byte instruction at offset 0 branches forward to offset 0 + 2 + 42 = 44.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  44: 1C                  SLDC 28
  45: 9E 15               CSP    21</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to the f---ing manual, "SLDC 28" pushes the decimal value 28 ($1C) to the stack. "CSP" stands for "call standard procedure." Apple Pascal has a number of built-in functions like "cos" (calculate a cosine) or "readln" (read a line of input). But what is standard procedure #21? The f---ing manual does not say. But I found a reference to it in "P-Source: A Guide to the Apple</p>
    <p>Pascal System" by Randall Hyde. On page 311 is the entire CSP table, and the 21st entry is "LDS" ("Load Segment").</p>
    <p class="seen">Quoting Hyde: "[LDS] pops the segment number off of the stack, gets it into the 6502 accumulator, and then calls the load segment subroutine. Upon return from load segment, control is returned to the main interpreter loop."</p>
    <p>But what segment are we loading? #28, which was just pushed to the stack in the previous instruction. But what is segment #28? According to Appendix A in the f---ing manual, segment 0 and segments 2-6 are reserved for the operating system. Segment 1 is the main program that is currently executing (SYSTEM.STARTUP in this case). Segments 7-21 are for segments and units defined within the program. And segments 22-31 are predefined intrinsic units.</p>
    <p>Apple Pascal includes several libraries like TURTLEGRAPHICS for Logo-like graphic commands and APPLESTUFF for access to joystick buttons and other hardware. But which one is #28? I finally found the answer in a post by "Tommy" on comp.sys.apple2 in a thread called "Wizardry re-engineering." Using a tool called LIBMAP, Tommy dug into the SYSTEM.LIBRARY file (part of the</p>
    <p>Apple Pascal operating system) and found the internal segment numbers for each intrinsic unit in Apple Pascal:</p>
    <p class="seen">20 TURTLEGRAPHICS (Logo-like graphics) 22 APPLESTUFF (hardware access) 28 CHAINSTUFF (launching programs) 29 TRANSCEND (geometry functions) 30 LONGINTIO (long integer support) 31 PASCALIO (parsing decimals)</p>
    <p class="seen">Thus, the p-code instruction "SLDC 28", followed by "CSP 21", will load the CHAINSTUFF intrinsic unit from SYSTEM.LIBRARY.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  47: B9 F4               UJP    -12</code>
    </div>
    <p>This is another unconditional jump, but according to the f---ing manual, negative parameters are not simply backward branches. Instead, they are referenced by their position in the "jump table" at the end of the procedure. This is the jump table:</p>
    <p class="seen">Jump table:</p>
    <p>52: 32 00 .WORD R2 (Entry # -12) 54: 14 00 .WORD R34 (Entry # -10)</p>
    <p>So the instruction "UJP -12" jumps to the address listed as "Entry # -12", which is R2. "2" refers to the instruction at byte offset 2, which is back near the beginning:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   2: CD 1C 01            CXP    28,1</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">"CXP" stands for "Call eXternal</p>
    <p class="seen">Procedure", and the f---ing manual says it takes two arguments, a segment # and a procedure # (in that order).</p>
    <p class="seen">According to Tommy, procedure #28 in segment #1 is "uses chainstuff". That makes sense, I suppose, since we just got finished loading that library into memory. Now we're signaling that we want to use it.</p>
    <p class="seen">That's it. Four hours of research, and "uses chainstuff" is as far as I've gotten. Did I mention I have no idea what I'm doing? This is fun. Are you having fun? I'm having fun.</p>

  <h3>Standard Procedure Is Best Procedure</h3>

    <p>Continuing at offset 5:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   5: 04                  SLDC 4
   6: A5 03               LAO    3
   8: 00                  SLDC 0
   9: C7 00 02            LDCI   512
  12: C7 10 01            LDCI   272
  15: 00                  SLDC 0
  16: 9E 05               CSP    5</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">According to the f---ing manual, "SLDC 4" just pushes the value 4 to the stack. (To conserve space, p-code has lots of one-byte instructions that all mean "push me to the stack.")</p>
    <p class="seen">"LAO" is "load global address". The f---ing manual has this to say about that: "LAO B. Fetch the word with offset 'B' in BASE activation record and push it." Then more pushing, then "CSP 5". According to Hyde, standard procedure #5 is "UREAD" (unit read).</p>
    <p class="seen">According to Tommy, the unit read procedure is a low-level disk read, like calling the RWTS directly under DOS 3.3. It takes 5 parameters. The first parameter is a volume number. In</p>
    <p class="seen">Apple Pascal, the volume number of the disk you're booting from is always 4. (I saw this earlier when I listed all online volumes from the Filer.) That explains the "SLDC 4" and "LAO 3" instructions. It's getting a reference to volume #4 and pushing it to the stack, in preparation for the unit read procedure to pull it off the stack and use the value as its first parameter.</p>
    <p>The second and third parameters to the UREAD function are BUFFER (0) and BUFFERSIZE (512). So we're storing the result of the read in a 512-byte buffer, which makes sense. Like ProDOS,</p>
    <p>Pascal organizes disks into "blocks" of two sectors each. There are 280 blocks on a 5.25-inch floppy.</p>
    <p>The 4th parameter is the block number to read. Since a block is two sectors, there are 8 blocks per track. Counting from 0, block 272 would be the first block of track $22. According to the "Comparison of Sector Skewing" figure in "Beneath Apple DOS" (p. 3-23), this block includes track $22, sector $00, which is was the only unreadable sector on the original disk.</p>
    <p>We are definitely on the right track.</p>
    <p>The "CSP 5" actually calls the UREAD function.</p>
    <p>Continuing at offset 18:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  18: 9E 22               CSP    34</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to Hyde, standard procedure #34 is "IOR". It pushes the value of the IORESULT global (set by UREAD) to the stack. In other words, we're checking whether the read worked. But remember! On the original disk, this block was unreadable, because T22,S00 was intentionally bad. There's no special logic here to change the RWTS to make it readable. The original disk is just reading the block like any other and checking to ensure that the read failed.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  20: 00                  SLDC 0
  21: CB                  NEQI</code>
    </div>
    <p>"SLDC" pushes 0 to the stack.</p>
    <p>"NQI" is an "is-not-equals" test. It compares the top value on the stack with the next-to-top value on the stack. The top value is 0, since the instruction just before it (at offset 28) was "SLDC 0". The next-to-top value is the return value from calling standard procedure #34. So I think this is saying "if UREAD did not return 0, then..."</p>
    <p class="seen">Then what?</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  22: A1 0A               FJP    10</code>
    </div>
    <p>"FJP" stands for "false jump," or less confusingly, "jump if false." If the previous test evaluated to false, then jump. The previous test was "did UREAD not return 0?" So I had it backwards in the previous paragraph. The proper prose description of this code is "if UREAD *did* return 0, then jump." Jump to where? Forward 10 bytes, to offset 22 + 2 + 10 = 34.</p>
    <p>Without decompiling every single instruction between 24 and 34, it seems pretty clear that this is the branch that my copy is taking and the original disk is not. The program expects block 272 to be unreadable, but on my copy, block 272 reads just fine. (This also explains why my EDD bit copy worked.)</p>
    <p>If I change that "NEQI" (is-not-equals) instruction at offset 21 to an "EQUI" (is-equals) instruction, that would reverse the logic entirely. Instead of saying, "if UREAD returned no error, branch to the failure path," it would say, "if UREAD returned an error, branch to the failure path."</p>
    <p>I like this solution for two reasons: first, it's the simplest thing that could possibly work. It's only a one- byte change, so it doesn't require inserting or removing any bytes of the p-code (which is convoluted and intimidating, to say the least). And second, I enjoy the irony of turning a copy protection check into a copy deprotection check.</p>
    <p>Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I searched the disk for the first few opcodes ("B9 2A CD 1C 01", from the very beginning of the procedure) and found this code on T11,S00. The f---ing manual tells me that the opcode for "NEQI" is $C3.</p>
    <p>T11,S00,$15 change "CB" to "C3"</p>
