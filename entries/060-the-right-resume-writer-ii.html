    <p>"The Right Resume Writer II" is a 1986 program by Duane Reed and distributed by Career Development Software, Inc.</p>
    <p>The on-disk documentation says I have version 1.1.</p>
    <p>Booting the original disk, it shows all the symptoms of loading DOS 3.3 and running a HELLO program of some sort.</p>
    <p>It does display "THE RIGHT RESUME WRITER II" on the text screen early in the boot, but then it continues with loading tracks 2, 1, and 0, displaying a "]" prompt, and swinging out to the middle of the disk (more or less, based solely on listening to my disk drive).</p>
    <p>COPYA fails miserably and immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 fares little better, with read errors on several tracks (no apparent pattern).</p>
    <p>Needless to say, the copy it produces does not work; it boots just enough to display "THE RIGHT RESUME WRITER II" before grinding the disk and crashing into the monitor.</p>
    <p>My trusty Copy ][+ sector editor can't make heads or tails of anything beyond track 0 (and only that with the "DOS</p>
    <p>3.3 PATCHED" option from the Sector</p>
    <p>Editor Patcher). But track 0 appears to have a DOS-shaped RWTS, so let's see if my AUTOTRACE program has any luck in extracting it.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S6,D1=original disk]
[S5,D1=my work disk]</code>

    </div>
    <p>Well... shoot. My work disk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which sets up a minimal boot trace to capture the first sector of track 0 and saves it to the file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, not the original disk). If the first sector looks reasonably normal, it runs AUTOTRACE1, which sets up a more involved boot trace to capture the rest of track 0 and save it to the file "BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonably normal, it saves the RWTS to a file, unimaginatively named "RWTS", which can be loaded with Advanced Demuffin to copy each track of the original disk to a duplicate with standard address/data prologue/epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p>But in this case, it only got as far as boot0, and I need to figure out why.</p>

      <p class="comment">oh, that's nice -- it was just using the reset vector as scratch space to save and restore the registers</p>

    <p>OK, this is all harmless (in terms of copy protection). The reason my AUTOTRACE program stopped is because $084A jumped to $08B3 instead of the usual ($08FD). But knowing that we're just going to continue with the normal boot1 flow soon enough, I can continue the auto-trace manually. (Yes yes, I am aware that's not very "auto," but let's not dwell on semantics.)</p>
    <p class="seen">The boot0 code is close enough to the normal DOS 3.3 code that my AUTOTRACE program should be able to capture the boot1 code, and hopefully the RWTS as well.</p>

    <p>Yes! I have the RWTS. Now to plug it in to Advanced Demuffin and see if I can convert this disk to a standard format. (Then I'll get to see if there are any nibble checks or other secondary protections.)</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. (EDD 4 bit copy gave a whole slew of read errors.) Whatever weird prologue sequences the original disk is using, it managed to confuse EDD 4. Impressive, in a twisted kind of way. But it shows the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>

    <p>Success! The disk boots and runs with no complaint. There doesn't appear to be any secondary protection.</p>
    <p>However, I've lost the title screen that displayed during early boot. If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to restore it. That's just how I roll.</p>
    <p>As you may recall, the title display routine was at $08B3 at the very end of the boot0 code. The entire T00,S00 is byte-for-byte identical to a freshly formatted DOS 3.3 disk (not the master disk, but a disk that you get by booting the master disk and typing "INIT HELLO") -- except for the part at $08B3 that displays the title, and the jump instruction at $084A that calls it.</p>
    <p class="seen">Using my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor,</p>
    <p>I copied T00,S00 from the original disk to my copy. Still boots and runs, and now I have the original title screen as well.</p>
