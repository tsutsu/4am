    <p>"Rapid Reader" is a 1981 educational program by Robert W. Smith.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails miserably and immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy gives errors on tracks $21 and $22, and the copy does not work. It boots with what sounds like a normal DOS (track 2, then 1, then 0), but then it just hangs with the drive motor running.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Sector Editor Patcher, and select "DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 PATCHED". This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p>As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track, except tracks $21 and $22.</p>
    <p class="seen">Track $11 appears to be a standard DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 disk catalog. T01,S09 lists HELLO as the autorun program.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my limited experience cracking other disks, I would guess that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+ sector editor would give read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p class="seen">So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my initial inspection with a sector editor, this disk loads DOS and runs a HELLO program. So it shouldn't be difficult to capture the RWTS and load it into Advanced Demuffin.</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, that worked flawlessly. My work disk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which sets up a minimal boot trace to capture the first sector of track 0 and saves it to the file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, not the original disk). If the first sector looks reasonably normal, it runs AUTOTRACE1, which sets up a more involved boot trace to capture the rest of track 0 and save it to the file "BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonably normal, it saves the RWTS to a file, unimaginatively named "RWTS", which can be loaded with Advanced Demuffin to copy each track of the original disk to a duplicate with standard address/data prologue/epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot 5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppy disks like some kind of 20th century nerd.</p>

    <p>I have good news and bad news. The good news is that my copy can now read itself. The bad news is that it still fails in the same way that my initial bit copy failed: after loading DOS, it clears the screen and hangs with the drive motor running.</p>
    <p>However, since this now has a standard DOS 3.3 on it, I can break to a prompt with <Ctrl-C>. (The original disk just rebooted when I tried to do that.)</p>

    <p>I recognize CALL 1002 -- that's $03EA, the routine that reconnects DOS. 1144 is $0478, which (despite appearances) is not part of the text screen, but is used by DOS to remember the current track number. Then it BLOADs "SVS", a file I saw in the disk catalog, and calls 24816, which is $60F0.</p>
