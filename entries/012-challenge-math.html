    <p>Challenge Math is a 1982 educational game programmed by C. McMahon and</p>
    <p>J. Sweedler, and distributed by distributed by Sunburst Communications.</p>
    <p class="seen">The original disk is uncopyable by COPYA or Locksmith Fast Disk</p>
    <p class="seen">Backup. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy just grinds a few times and reboots.</p>
    <p class="seen">Some manual inspection with the Copy ][+ nibble editor reveals that each track has a different address and data prologue:</p>
    <p class="seen">Track | Address | Data ------+----------+----------</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, that worked flawlessly. My work disk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which sets up a minimal boot trace to capture the first sector of track 0 and saves it to the file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, not the original disk). If the first sector looks reasonably normal, it runs AUTOTRACE1, which sets up a more involved boot trace to capture the rest of track 0 and save it to the file "BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonably normal, it saves the RWTS to a file, unimaginatively named "RWTS", which can be loaded with Advanced Demuffin to copy each track of the original disk to a duplicate with standard address/data prologue/epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot 5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppy disks like some kind of 15th century serf.</p>

    <p>Hmm. The disk's own RWTS can't read one single sector on track $11? That's odd. And T11,S0F is usually the first sector of the VTOC, so this is potentially fatal.</p>
    <p class="seen">Rebooting my work disk, I can see the disk catalog on the demuffin'd copy, despite the read error on T11,S0F. I make a mental note to investigate this later.</p>

    <p class="seen">The game loads and runs without complaint. All further disk access is done through standard DOS functions.</p>
    <p class="seen">There don't appear to be any nibble checks or any other form of secondary protection.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now to make the disk be able to read itself (remember, it still has the original RWTS on it)...</p>
    <p class="seen">Using Copy ][+, I can "copy DOS" from a freshly initialized DOS 3.3 (or compatible) disk onto the demuffin'd copy. I actually chose ProntoDOS for this purpose, since it's highly compatible with standard DOS 3.3 but much faster. (This function of Copy ][+ just sector-copies tracks 0-2 from one disk to another, but it's easier than setting that up manually in some other copy program.)</p>

    <p class="seen">POSTSCRIPT: because you thought I'd forgotten about that unreadable sector on track $11.</p>
    <p class="seen">Normally under DOS 3.3, track $11 contains the VTOC. T11,S00 points to T11,S0F, which contains metadata (name, type, and a pointer to the track/sector list that contains pointers to the actual file data) about the first few files that you see when you type CATALOG. T11,S0F normally points to T11,S0E, which holds the same sort of information on the next few files, and so on.</p>
    <p>But on the original Challenge Math disk, T11,S00 points to T11,S0D instead, as shown in this annotated screen capture from my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor:</p>

    <p class="seen">For whatever reason, the original copy protection developer -- AFTER they changed the prologue sequences on every single track to nonstandard values -- decided that they weren't quite done, so they made a sector that even their own custom RWTS couldn't read. And they chose the sector that normally kicks off the disk catalog, just because... I'm not sure, exactly. Once</p>
    <p class="seen">I ran the disk through Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin, I had no problem cataloging the disk from my work disk (which boots</p>
    <p class="seen">Diversi-DOS). Maybe some other disk utilities are confused by a VTOC that starts on T11,S0D instead of T11,S0F.</p>
