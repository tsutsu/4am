  <h3>In Which Various Automated Tools Fail In Interesting Ways</h3>

    <p class="seen">COPYA</p>

    <p>T00 -> looks like DOS 3.3 RWTS T00-T02 -> looks like full DOS 3.3 T01,S09 -> startup program is "W.SPC"</p>
    <p class="seen">Why didn't any of my copies work?</p>
    <p>probably a nibble check in the startup program</p>
    <p>A well-timed <Ctrl-Reset> gets me a prompt, but any command reboots again.</p>
    <p class="seen">Next steps:</p>
    <p>1. Load and trace the startup program</p>

    <p>Aha! It's not an infinite loop after all. Well, it is, technically, but it won't actually run forever. It's not easy to show in plain text, but the initial "D" and the final "M@" are in inverse. So that string starts with</p>
    <p>Ctrl-D and ends with Ctrl-M and a null byte. Since DOS is already loaded, printing this through the DOS vector will execute that command, as if you typed it from a prompt yourself. Since that program never returns to the caller, it will break out of the seemingly "infinite" loop.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <h3>In Which We Use Latin Phrases We Don't Fully Understand</h3>

    <p class="seen">After minutes of furious investigation,</p>
    <p>I hit upon the source of the problem: the disk volume number. The original disk uses disk volume 001, but the copy</p>
    <p>I got out of Locksmith Fast Disk Backup just copies sector data from one disk to another. The blank disk I started with was initialized with disk volume 254 (this is encoded in every sector's address field), and Locksmith FDB never changed that.</p>
    <p>Why is this a problem? Well, besides appearing in every sector's address field, the volume number is stored in four different places when a disk is initialized with DOS 3.3:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. $B7EB (T00,S01,$EB), in the RWTS</p>
    <p class="seen">parameter table used by boot1 to load DOS from tracks 0-2 ["Beneath</p>
    <p class="seen">Apple DOS", p. 8-35]</p>
    <p class="seen">2. $B7F6 (T00,S01,$F6), also in the</p>
    <p class="seen">RWTS parameter table, as the "last found" disk volume</p>
    <p class="seen">3. $AA66 (T01,S09,$66), in the parsed</p>
    <p class="seen">keyword table used by DOS to load the startup program (and every other file loaded after that) [ibid., p. 8-21]</p>
    <p class="seen">4. $B3C1 (T11,S00,$06), in the VTOC</p>
    <p class="seen">header [ibid., p. 8-32]</p>
    <p class="seen">My (non-working) copy has a $01 in each of those locations. Since this doesn't match the actual disk volume number in the address fields, every sector read fails and DOS never loads. (Why did it work when I booted from my work disk?</p>
    <p class="seen">Because that loaded DOS from a separate disk that was already disk volume 254, thus matching up with the actual disk volume number in my non-working copy's address fields.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Using my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I changed each of the aforementioned locations to $FE.</p>
    <p class="seen">T00,S01,$EB change 01 to FE T00,S01,$F6 change 01 to FE T01,S09,$66 change 01 to FE T11,S06,$06 change 01 to FE</p>
    <p class="seen">Success! My copy finally boots and runs on its own. There doesn't appear to be any further copy protection.</p>
