    <p>That took 23 tries. Attempts 1-10 were full of read errors because the disk was so dirty that it kept coating my floppy drive with muck. Attempts 11-20 got the number of read errors down to about five per rip, but my attempts to stitch together a working copy (by copying individual sectors from different copies) failed. The RWTS had reported that the reads had "succeeded" because some bit on the weaker sectors flipped in just the right combination that the data field checksum passed.</p>
    <p>Unsurprisingly, this crashed the game, because executable code doesn't take kindly to random bit flipping.</p>

    <p class="seen">A short digression here into some super low-level disk stuff, because this wasn't low-level enough already...</p>
    <p class="seen">$E7 $E7 $E7 $E7. What would that nibble sequence look like on disk? The answer is, "It depends." $E7 in hexadecimal is 11100111 in binary, so here is the simplest possible answer:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   |--E7--||--E7--||--E7--||--E7--|
   11100111111001111110011111100111</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">But wait. Every nibble read from disk must have its high bit set. In theory, you could insert one or two "0" bits after any of those nibbles. (Two is the maximum, due to hardware limitations.)</p>
    <p class="seen">These extra "0" bits would be swallowed by the standard "wait for data latch to have its high bit set" loop, which you see over and over in any RWTS code:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  :1   LDA $C08C,X
       BPL :1</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Now consider the following bitstream:</p>
    <p class="seen">|--E7--| |--E7--| |--E7--||--E7--| 11100111011100111001110011111100111 ^ ^^ (extra) (extra)</p>
    <p class="seen">The first $E7 has one extra "0" bit after it, and the second $E7 has two extra "0" bits after it. Totally legal, works on any Apple II computer and any floppy drive. A "LDA $C08C,X; BPL" loop would still interpret this bitstream as a sequence of four $E7 nibbles. Each of the extra "0" bits appear after we've just read a nibble and we're waiting for the high bit to be set again.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now, what if we miss the first few bits of this bitstream, then start looking?</p>
    <p class="seen">The disk is always spinning, whether we're reading from it or not. If we waste too much time doing something other than reading, we'll literally miss some bits as the disk spins by.</p>
    <p class="seen">This is why the timing of low-level RWTS code is so critical.</p>
    <p class="seen">Let's say we waste 12 CPU cycles before we start reading this bitstream. Each bit takes 4 CPU cycles to go by, so after 12 cycles, we would have missed the first 3 bits (marked with an X).</p>
    <p class="seen">(normal start)</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  |--E7--| |--E7--|  |--E7--||--E7--|
  11100111011100111001110011111100111
  XXX  |--EE--| |--E7--|  |--FC--|</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">(delayed start)</p>
    <p class="seen">Ah! It's interpreted as a completely different nibble sequence if you delay just a few CPU cycles before you start reading. Also note that some of those "extra" bits are no longer being ignored; now they're being interpreted as data, as part of the nibbles that are being returned to the higher level code. Meanwhile, other bits that were part of the $E7 nibbles are now being swallowed.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now, let's go back to the first stream, which had no extra bits between the nibbles, and see what happens when we waste those same 12 CPU cycles.</p>
    <p class="seen">(normal start)</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   |--E7--||--E7--||--E7--||--E7--|
   11100111111001111110011111100111
   XXX  |--FC--||--FC--||--FC--|</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">(delayed start)</p>
    <p class="seen">After skipping the first three bits, the stream is interpreted as a series of $FC $FC $FC repeating endlessly -- not $EE $E7 $FC like the other stream.</p>
    <p class="seen">Here's the kicker: generic bit copiers didn't preserve these extra "0" bits between nibbles. By "desynchronizing" (wasting just the right number of CPU cycles at just the right time), then interpreting the bits on the disk in mid-stream, developers could determine at runtime whether you had an original disk. Which is precisely the code we just saw.</p>
    <p class="seen">Here is the complete "E7 bitstream," annotated to show both the synchronized and desynchronized nibble sequences.</p>
