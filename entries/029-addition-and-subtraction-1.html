    <p>"Blast Off: Addition and Subtraction 1" is a 1985 educational program authored by Thomas Hartsig. It is part of the "Mathematics Courseware Series" distributed by Scott, Foresman and</p>
    <p class="seen">Company.</p>
    <p>COPYA copies the disk without incident, but the copy does not work. After a fair amount of disk reading, it displays the following message:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>
THIS IS AN ILLEGAL COPY AND WILL NOT</code>
      <code>RUN.  PRESS ANY KEY TO LEAVE.</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen"></p>
    <p>I have decided to ignore this advice.</p>
    <p>The program appears to be written in</p>
    <p>Apple Pascal. The boot process starts with several sequential disk reads, then fills the screen with null bytes, then clears the screen and displaying a block cursor in the upper-left corner.</p>
    <p>Anyone who has ever played Wizardry or GATO will recognize the Apple Pascal boot sequence.</p>
    <p>Pulling out my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I search for the text "ILLEGAL" and find nothing. But searching for the hex sequence "49 4C 4C 45" ("ILLE" without the high bit set) does find the error message on T22,S09.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the disassembly of the surrounding code makes no sense -- because it's not assembly language!</p>
    <p>It's p-code.</p>
    <p>"What is p-code?" I hear you cry. I'm glad you asked. Pascal was not limited to the Apple II. Apple Pascal was an implementation of USCD Pascal, which defined a cross-platform representation of "compiled" Pascal code ("p-code").</p>
    <p>Quoting from <http://www.threedee.com/jcm/psystem/></p>
    <div class="curses">
      <code>What is the UCSD P-System?</code>
      <code>It is a portable operating system that
was popular in the early days of
personal computers, in the late 1970s
and early 1980s.</code>
      <code>Like today's [note: this article was
written in 2004 -4am] Java, it was
based on a "virtual machine" with a
standard set of low-level, machine-
language-like "p-code" instructions
that were emulated on different
hardware, including the 6502, the 8080,
the Z-80, and the PDP-11. In this way,
a Pascal compiler that emitted p-code
executables could produce a program
that could be run under the P-System on
an Apple II, a Xerox 820, or a DEC
PDP-11.</code>
      <code>The most popular language for the
P-System was UCSD Pascal. In fact, the
P-System operating system itself was
written in UCSD Pascal, making the
entire operating system relatively easy
to port between platforms.</code>
      <code>By writing a p-code interpreter in the
platform's native assembly language,
and a few minimal hooks to operating
system functions for the file system
and interacting with the user, you
could move a p-code executable from
another system and run it on the new
platform. In this way, the p-code
generated on one computer could be used
to bootstrap the port of the P-System
to another computer.</code>

    <p>Here endeth the history lesson and starteth the hacking.</p>
    <p>The first thing I'll need is an Apple</p>
    <p>Pascal work disk, instead of my usual (DOS 3.3-compatible) Diversi-DOS disk.</p>
    <p>The second thing is a p-code decompiler from <http://apple2.callapple.org/software/ tribby/apascal.html></p>

    <p>Wow. That seems like a lot of useful information, but what does it tell me?</p>
    <p>I am by no means an expert here. This is my first foray into Pascal hacking and decompiling. (I do recognize the nibble check in procedure #2, though. I can smell those a mile away.)</p>
    <p>Here are some references on Apple</p>
    <p>Pascal hacking that I found helpful:</p>
    <p>The "Apple Pascal Operating System</p>
    <p>Reference Manual", currently available at <http://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20I</p>
    <p>I%20Documentation%20Project/Software/Op erating%20Systems/Apple%20Pascal/Manual s/Apple%20Pascal%20Operating%20System%2 0Reference%20Manual.pdf></p>
    <p>Appendices A and B of that manual are available in plain text at <http://www.siconic.com/crap/pascal></p>
    <p>"P-Source: A Guide to the Apple Pascal</p>
    <p>System" by Randall Hyde, currently available at <http://pascal.hansotten.com/index.php? page=books></p>
    <p>In 2012, "Tommy" wrote a series of posts on comp.sys.apple2 (yes, the</p>
    <p>Usenet newsgroup) called "Re-engineered: Wizardry III, Legacy of</p>
    <p>Llylgamyn", currently available at <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.s ys.apple2/2oDJTbQaJWU/Vge7HkIcYYwJ></p>
    <p>In 2014, "Tommy" was encouraged to write another series on comp.sys.apple2 called "Wizardry re-engineering", currently available at <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.s ys.apple2/aI5ob1mLUwY/xNXh2wro6KQJ></p>
    <p>Armed with just enough information to be dangerous, I set out on an adventure of Pascal decompiling!</p>
    <p>Under the "Disassembly of procedure 1", the first instruction looks like this:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   0: B9 F4                 UJP    -12</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to Appendix A in the Apple</p>
    <p>Pascal Operating System Reference</p>
    <p>Manual (hereafter known as "the f---ing manual"), "UJP" is an unconditional jump. Unlike 6502 assembly language, all jumps are referenced by their position in a "jump table" at the end of the procedure. This is the jump table for this procedure:</p>
    <p>Jump table:</p>
    <p>244: F2 00 .WORD R2 (Entry # -14) 246: 09 00 .WORD R237 (Entry # -12) 248: 47 00 .WORD R177 (Entry # -10)</p>
    <p>So the instruction "UJP -12" jumps to the address listed as "Entry # -12", which is R237. "237" refers to the instruction at byte offset 237, which is listed near the end of the procedure:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code> 237: 1C                    SLDC 28
 238: 9E 15                 CSP    21
 240: B9 F2                 UJP    -14</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to the f---ing manual, "SLDC 28" pushes the decimal value 28 ($1C) to the stack. "CSP" stands for "call standard procedure." Apple Pascal has a number of built-in functions like "cos" (calculate a cosine) or "readln" (read a line of input). But what is standard procedure #21? The f---ing manual does not say. But Hyde's book does; page 331 has the entire CSP table, and the 21st entry is "LDS" ("Load Segment").</p>
    <p>Quoting Hyde: "[LDS] pops the segment number off of the stack, gets it into the 6502 accumulator, and then calls the load segment subroutine. Upon return from load segment, control is returned to the main interpreter loop."</p>
    <p>OK, but what segment are we loading? #28, which was just pushed to the stack in the previous instruction. But what is segment #28? According to Appendix A in the f---ing manual, segment 0 and segments 2-6 are reserved for the operating system. Segment 1 is the main program that is currently executing (SYSTEM.STARTUP in this case). Segments 7-21 are for segments and units defined within the program. And segments 22-31 are predefined intrinsic units.</p>
    <p>Apple Pascal includes several libraries like TURTLEGRAPHICS for Logo-like graphic commands and APPLESTUFF for access to joystick buttons and other hardware. But which one is #28? I finally found the answer in one of</p>
    <p>Tommy's posts in his "Wizardry re- engineering" series. Using a tool called LIBMAP, Tommy dug into the SYSTEM.LIBRARY file (part of the Apple</p>
    <p>Pascal operating system) and found the internal segment numbers for each intrinsic unit in Apple Pascal.</p>
    <p>20 TURTLEGRAPHICS (Logo-like graphics) 22 APPLESTUFF (hardware access) 28 CHAINSTUFF (launching programs) 29 TRANSCEND (geometry functions) 30 LONGINTIO (long integer support) 31 PASCALIO (parsing decimals)</p>
    <p>Thus, the p-code instruction "SLDC 28", followed by "CSP 21", will load the CHAINSTUFF intrinsic unit from SYSTEM.LIBRARY.</p>
    <p>"UJP -14" is an unconditional jump to the address listed in the jump table under Entry # -14, which is R2. So that means we're jumping to the instruction at byte offset 2, which is right after the first unconditional jump.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   2: CD 1C 01              CXP    28,1</code>
    </div>
    <p>"CXP" stands for "Call eXternal</p>
    <p>Procedure", and the f---ing manual says it takes two arguments, a segment # and a procedure # (in that order).</p>
    <p>According to Tommy, procedure #28 in segment #1 is "uses chainstuff". That makes sense, I suppose, since we just got finished loading that library into memory. Now we're signaling that we want to use it.</p>
    <p>That's it. Four hours of research, and "uses chainstuff" is as far as I've gotten. Did I mention I have no idea what I'm doing? This is fun. Are you having fun? I'm having fun.</p>
    <p>Moving on.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>   5: 04                    SLDC 4
   6: A5 03                 LAO    3
   8: 00                    SLDC 0
   9: 01                    SLDC 1
  10: 00                    SLDC 0
  11: 00                    SLDC 0
  12: 9E 05                 CSP    5</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to the f---ing manual, "SLDC 4" just pushes the value 4 to the stack. (To conserve space, p-code has lots of one-byte instructions that all mean "push me to the stack.")</p>
    <p>"LAO" is "load global address". The f---ing manual has this to say about that: "LAO B. Fetch the word with offset 'B' in BASE activation record and push it." Then more pushing, then "CSP 5". According to Hyde, standard procedure #5 is "UREAD" (unit read).</p>
    <p>According to Tommy, the unit read procedure is a low-level disk read, like calling the RWTS directly under DOS 3.3. It takes 5 parameters. The first parameter is a volume number. In</p>
    <p>Apple Pascal, the volume number of the disk you're booting from is always 4. (I saw this earlier when I listed all online volumes from the Filer.) That explains the "SLDC 4" and "LAO 3" instructions. It's getting a reference to volume #4 and pushing it to the stack, in preparation for the unit read procedure to pull it off the stack and use the value as its first parameter.</p>
    <p>Damn, this is slow going.</p>
    <p>Anyway, if I'm right that the embedded assembly language procedure is a nibble check, then this Pascal code makes sense. It needs to position the drive head properly before it can do the nibble check, since the special nibble sequence is usually only stored in one place on the disk.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  14: B6 01 03              LOD    1,3
  17: 0C                    SLDC 12
  18: 00                    SLDC 0
  19: CD 00 11              CXP    0,17</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to Tommy, procedure #17 in segment 0 is "WRITE()". As in, write things on the screen. I'm not sure what it's writing, but I'm going to optimistically skip over it and hope it isn't important.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  22: 9E 00                 CSP    0</code>
    </div>
    <p>According to Hyde, standard procedure 0 is IOCHECK. It checks the result of the last I/O operation and triggers a run-time error if it's non-zero. I'm assuming this is checking the result of the unit read procedure that positioned the drive head.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  24: 00                    SLDC 0
  25: 00                    SLDC 0
  26: CE 02                 CLP    2</code>
    </div>
    <p>The f---ing manual says that "CLP" standards for "call local procedure."</p>
    <p>From the decompiler listing I got, local procedure #2 is the embedded assembly language routine -- i.e. the nibble check. This is it! This is where it calls the nibble check!</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  28: 00                    SLDC 0
  29: C3                    EQUI</code>
    </div>
    <p>"EQUI" is an "is-equals" test. It compares the top value on the stack with the next-to-top value on the stack. The top value is 0, since the instruction just before it (at offset 28) was "SLDC 0". The next-to-top value is the return value from calling local procedure #2. So I think this is saying "if the nibble check returned 0, then."</p>
    <p>Then what?</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  30: A1 F6                 FJP    -10</code>
    </div>
    <p>"FJP" stands for "false jump," or less confusingly, "jump if false." If the previous test evaluated to false, then jump. The previous test was "did the nibble check return 0?" So I had it backwards in the previous paragraph.</p>
    <p>The proper prose description of this code is "if the nibble check did not return 0, then jump." Jump to where? To the offset listed in the jump table under Entry #-10, which is R177.</p>
    <p>Without decompiling every single instruction between 30 and 177, it seems pretty clear that this is the branch we want to take (but don't, because the nibble check fails and returns 0). In between 30 and 177, I see the exact error message about "THIS IS AN ILLEGAL COPY" blah blah whatever.</p>
    <p>This jump-if-false branches right over all of that and goes on with the real business of SYSTEM.STARTUP, which is presumably to use the intrinsic library CHAINSTUFF to launch the main program.</p>
    <p>If I change that "EQUI" (is-equals) instruction at offset 29 to a "NEQI" (is-not-equals) instruction, that would reverse the logic entirely. Instead of saying, "if the nibble check failed, display this message and hang," it would say, "if the nibble check succeeds, display an error message and hang."</p>
    <p>I like this solution for two reasons: first, it's the simplest thing that could possibly work. It's only a one- byte change, so it doesn't require inserting or removing any bytes of the p-code (which is convoluted and intimidating, to say the least). And second, I enjoy the irony of a program that does a nibble check but complains about success instead of failure.</p>
    <p>Whipping out my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I go back to the sector where I originally found the error message and confirm that the surrounding bytes are identical to the p-code that I've been decompiling. With a mix of trepidation and optimism, I make one small change:</p>
    <p>T22,S09,$1D change "C3" to "CB"</p>
    <p>It worked! It actually worked! The copy boots and runs!</p>
    <p>I have two other disks by the same company that use the same copy protection routine:</p>
    <p>- Addition and Subtraction 2</p>
    <p>T0C,S0B,$1D change "C3" to "CB"</p>
    <p>- Frog Jump: Ordering Numbers</p>
    <p class="seen">T0C,S0B,$1D change "C3" to "CB"</p>
    <p class="seen">Quod erat liberandum.</p>
