    <p>"M-ss-ng-L-nks" is a 1984 educational game designed by Carol Chomsky and</p>
    <p>Judah L. Schwartz; programmed by Harry</p>
    <p>Chomsky, Judah L. Schwartz, Jon Kaplan,</p>
    <p>Richard Gersh, and Jonathan Sweedler; and distributed by Sunburst</p>
    <p>Communications, Inc.</p>

"FOR Your NEXT Adventure," also
distributed by Sunburst. This write-up
is therefore quite similar to that one,
with a few corrections.]</code>

    <p class="seen">The original disk is uncopyable by COPYA or Locksmith Fast Disk Backup. EDD 4 bit copy gives read errors on tracks $13 and up. Oddly, when I look at the original disk with the Copy ][+ nibble editor, those "unreadable" tracks do appear to be formatted and to contain data. Needless to say, the copy does not work.</p>
    <p class="seen">Further inspection in the nibble editor reveals that each track has a different address and data prologue:</p>
    <p class="seen">Track | Address | Data ------+----------+----------</p>
    <p class="seen">$00 | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD (normal) $01 | D5 AA 97 | D5 AA AE $02 | D5 AA 9A | D5 AA AF $03 | D5 AA 9B | D5 AA B2 $04 | D5 AA 9D | D5 AA B3</p>
    <p class="seen">And so on.</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, that worked flawlessly. My work disk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which sets up a minimal boot trace to capture the first sector of track 0 and saves it to the file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, not the original disk). If the first sector looks reasonably normal, it runs AUTOTRACE1, which sets up a more involved boot trace to capture the rest of track 0 and save it to the file "BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonably normal, it saves the RWTS to a file, unimaginatively named "RWTS", which can be loaded with Advanced Demuffin to copy each track of the original disk to a duplicate with standard address/data prologue/epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p class="seen">Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot 5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppy disks like some kind of 20th century peasant.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. (EDD 4 bit copy gave a whole slew of read errors.) Whatever weird prologue sequences the original disk is using, it managed to confuse EDD 4. Impressive, in a twisted kind of way. But it shows the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
