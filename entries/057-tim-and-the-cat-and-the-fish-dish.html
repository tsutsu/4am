    <p>"Tim and the Cat and the Fish Dish" is a 1988 educational program by Janet</p>
    <p class="seen">Goldman and distributed by Hartley</p>
    <p class="seen">Courseware, Inc. It comes on two disks, each bootable.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[The copy protection is identical to
"Tim and the Cat and The Big Red Hat,"
also distributed by Hartley Courseware.
This write-up is therefore quite
similar to that one, with a few minor
corrections.]</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy gives no errors, and the copy works, which suggests that this disk many not use any secondary protection beyond the non-standard disk structure. (I have seem some weaker nibble checks that can be defeated with a strong bit copier, so you never know until you try.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Sector Editor Patcher, and select "DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 PATCHED". This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p class="seen">As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">The Copy ][+ nibble editor also shows standard address and data prologues, but an address epilogue of DA AA FF and a data epilogue of DA AA EB. (The standard epilogues are "DE AA EB" for both.)</p>

    <p class="seen">Some quick inspection suggests that all tracks on each disk use the same non- standard address and data epilogue bytes. I could probably use COPYA with the $B942:18 patch to copy these disks, but instead I'm going to try another utility that I just learned about:</p>
    <p class="seen">Super Demuffin.</p>
    <p class="seen">Super Demuffin is a cracker's utility built on top of Locksmith Fast Disk</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy. It takes a disk that uses non- standard but uniform address and data prologue and epilogue bytes, and it converts it to a standard disk format.</p>
    <p class="seen">I've included a copy on my work disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">When you first run Super Demuffin, it asks for the parameters of the original disk. In this case, the prologue bytes are the same, but the epilogues use "DA" instead of "DE". I just need to change those two parameters (shown below). The third byte of the address epilogue is not important, since most DOS 3.3-shaped RWTSes ignore it.</p>

    <p class="seen">(I do this for both disks.)</p>
    <p class="seen">This gives me copies in a standard disk format, but I still need to modify the RWTS on disk to look for the (now standard) epilogue bytes. Switching to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I search for the hex byte "DA" and find all four instances (address epilogue read and write, data epilogue read and write).</p>
    <p class="seen">For future reference (mostly mine), here's a nice chart of the memory locations for all the prologues and epilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. If the RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (most do), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02; $B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.</p>
