    <p class="seen">Terrapin Logo is an implementation of the Logo programming language. It was written by L. Klotz, P. Sobalvarro, and</p>
    <p class="seen">S. Hain under the supervision of H.</p>
    <p>Abelson. This is version 2.0, distributed in 1984 by Terrapin, Inc.</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy just reboots endlessly.</p>
    <p class="seen">In my experience, programs do not spontaneously reboot unless someone tells them to.</p>
    <p>The original disk appears to boot a modified DOS 3.3. Listening to the disk drive, it quickly moves out to track 2, then back to track 1, then track 0, then swings out to track $11 to read the disk catalog and load the startup program (HELLO or similar). The DOS load takes just slightly longer than I would expect. Or it could just be my imagination.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I go to "Input/Output Control" (press "O") and set CHECKSUM ENABLED = NO. This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences -- as long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format. (It uses the disk's own RWTS to read the original, then a standard DOS 3.3- compatible RWTS to write out the data, sector by sector.)</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>

    <p class="seen">Success! The main program loads and runs without complaint. Something in the loader program must be accessing DOS locations directly instead of using the vectors on page 3. (None of the usual DOS locations work because my work disk uses 64K Diversi-DOS.)</p>
    <p class="seen">But this is definitely a good sign. It tells me that the program itself doesn't care about the DOS that loaded it, once it's loaded. Some programs will check for DOS-specific quirks and fail if they detect that they were loaded from anything but the original disk's custom DOS. But I don't see any evidence of that here.</p>

    <p class="seen">...no dice. The disk grinds, unable to read itself. This is not unusual. A lot of disks need some sort of post- demuffin patching, and I got tired of doing it manually, so I wrote a program to do it for me. It is called, unsurprisingly, Post-Demuffin Patcher.</p>
    <p class="seen">It prompts you to select a slot and drive, then reads the demuffin'd disk, checks for a modified DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS, and applies the necessary patches so the disk can read itself. (It can also detect and bypass some nibble checks.) I've included a copy of Post-</p>

    <p>This is the actual output of the program. Post-Demuffin Patcher prints out the changes it is going to make before it writes them to the disk. The first four lines are just modifying epilogue bytes. The last line is interesting though. I want to go back to the bootloader code I captured earlier to see what that's about.</p>
