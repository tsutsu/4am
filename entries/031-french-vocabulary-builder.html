    <p>"French Vocabulary Builder" is a 1982 educational program distributed by</p>
    <p>Control Data Corporation as part of their "Plato Courseware" series.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy appears to work, but the copy just hangs on boot.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I find the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option (press "P" to go to the Sector</p>
    <p class="seen">Editor Patcher) allows me to read every sector on every track. Track 0 feels like a DOS 3.3 RWTS, and I see a VTOC on track $11.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my experience with other disks, this evidence suggests that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+ sector editor would give read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">The easiest way to convert the disk to standard epilogue bytes is to use COPYA with a patched RWTS that accepts any epilogue bytes on read but includes standard epilogue bytes on write.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S6D1=DOS 3.3 master disk]</code>
    </div>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>]PR#6
...
]CALL -151
*B942:18
*3D0G
]RUN COPYA</code>
    </div>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S6D1=original disk]
[S6D2=blank disk]</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">...read read read... ...grind grind grind... ...write write write...</p>
    <p>OK, now I have a copy in standard disk format that can be read by any tools. i.e. I can copy the disk that's in drive 2 with COPYA without patching the RWTS beforehand. I can sector edit the disk without messing with the Sector</p>
    <p>Editor Patcher.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original disk</p>
    <p>was written, this copy may or may not be able to read itself. I may need to patch the disk's RWTS to deal with the fact that the disk is in a standard format. Or I may be able to replace the DOS completely.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p class="seen">get very far, because it still has some sort of secondary protection checking if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p>To investigate problem #1, let's see if</p>
    <p>I can see any files on the disk.</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>]CATALOG,S6,D2</code>
    </div>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>DISK VOLUME 254</code>
      <code> A 003 HELLO
*B 003 APHANGM.SHAPES
 B 036 APFRNCH1.OBJ

*T 009 APWFRE9</code>
    </div>
    <p>My suspicion was correct: this disk has a standard disk catalog. It even has a HELLO program. That looks inviting.</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>]RUN HELLO</code>
    </div>
    <p>Success! The program loads and runs without complaint. That tells me that whatever was causing the copy to hang during boot was confined to the boot.</p>
    <p>In other words, the copy protection was entirely contained within the custom RWTS and DOS on tracks 0-2 of the original disk. Booting from the DOS 3.3 master disk, I was just able to run the program -- from drive 2, no less!</p>
    <p>So, if I'm right, I don't need to worry about problem #2 at all (the copy protection routine). To getting a fully working copy, all I need to do is to overwrite the disk's custom DOS with a standard DOS.</p>
    <p>I usually choose Pronto-DOS by Beagle</p>
    <p>Bros. for this purpose, since it's highly compatible with DOS 3.3 but much faster. I keep a freshly formatted</p>
    <p>Pronto-DOS disk around for precisely this occasion.</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+</p>
    <p>--> COPY --> DOS --> from slot 6, drive 2 --> to slot 6, drive 1</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S6D1=my non-working copy]
[S6D2=newly formatted Pronto-DOS disk]</code>
    </div>
    <p>...read read read... ...write write write...</p>
    <p class="seen">Quod erat liberandum.</p>
