    <p>To Kill A Mockingbird is a 1983 educational program distributed by</p>
    <p>Media Basics, Inc.</p>
    <p class="seen">The original disk is uncopyable by COPYA or Locksmith Fast Disk</p>
    <p class="seen">Backup. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy just grinds a few times and reboots.</p>
    <p>Some manual inspection with the Copy ][+ nibble editor reveals that every odd track has a non-standard address prologue:</p>
    <p class="seen">Track | Address | Data ------+----------+----------</p>
    <p>$00 | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $01 | D4 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $02 | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $03 | D4 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $04 | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $05 | D4 AA 96 | D5 AA AD</p>
    <p class="seen">And so on.</p>
    <p class="seen">Time for boot tracing with AUTOTRACE.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S5D1=my work disk]
[S6D1=original disk]</code>
    </div>
    <div class="line_editing">

    </div>
    <p>Hmm, something about track 0 sector 0 is non-standard, because my AUTOTRACE program bailed after capturing it.</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>0839-   EE FE 08    INC   $08FE
083C-   EE FE 08    INC   $08FE
083F-   20 89 FE    JSR   $FE89
0842-   20 93 FE    JSR   $FE93
0845-   20 2F FB    JSR   $FB2F
0848-   A6 2B       LDX   $2B
084A-   4C F0 08    JMP   $08F0</code>
    </div>
    <p>That's the first non-standard thing I see: at $084A, a normal DOS 3.3 boot sector would do a JMP ($08FD), which would jump to the code stored in T00,S01 (usually at $B700, but not always, hence the indirection). But this disk has something different in mind.</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>08F0-   A9 AA       LDA   #$AA
08F2-   85 31       STA   $31
08F4-   A9 00       LDA   #$00
08F6-   8D F1 B6    STA   $B6F1
08F9-   4C 00 B7    JMP   $B700</code>
    </div>
    <p>OK, so it's storing a constant in zero page $31, then zeroing out a byte in the $B600 range, then doing a direct jump to boot1 at $B700. The zeroing out thing is a nice touch. Track 0, sector 0 is actually loaded twice: once at $0800 by the disk controller ROM routine at $C600, then again at $B600 by the boot0 code at $0800. Then the $0800 page is usually overwritten by the HELLO program or whatever auto-runs after DOS is fully loaded, but the $B600 page remains memory. When you INIT a disk, it's the $B600 page that gets written to track 0, sector 0. All of which means that, if you manage to boot this disk, break out of the program and get to a BASIC prompt, and try to INIT a disk with this custom DOS, the freshly formatted disk will be slightly different than the original, because the value at $B6F1 was zeroed out.</p>
    <p>I still have no idea what that value is used for, but it's obviously important enough for the bootloader to try to hide it.</p>
    <p>Continuing, then, with the boot tracing, by patching myself in at $08F9. (This is TRACE1 on my work disk.)</p>

    <p>Well that didn't work. At all. The original disk's own RWTS couldn't read a single sector of ... the original disk. WTF?</p>
    <p>Digging into the custom RWTS I captured, I finally hit upon the root of the problem. Remember that value in zero page $31? That turns out to be used by the RWTS itself.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>B925-   BC 8C C0    LDY   $C08C,X
B928-   10 FB       BPL   $B925
B92A-   D9 00 BA    CMP   $BA00,Y
B92D-   D0 13       BNE   $B942
B92F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,X
B932-   10 FB       BPL   $B92F
B934-   C9 DE       CMP   #$DE
B936-   D0 0A       BNE   $B942
B938-   EA          NOP
B939-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,X
B93C-   10 FB       BPL   $B939
B93E-   C5 31       CMP   $31
B940-   F0 5C       BEQ   $B99E
B942-   38          SEC
B943-   60          RTS</code>
    </div>
    <p>Normally at $B93E, the RWTS would compare to a constant value, like CMP #$AA. But this RWTS is comparing to the value of zero page $31. Which, as you recall, contains the value $AA. Except when it doesn't, like when some enterprising hacker tries to reuse the custom RWTS in a new context (like</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin) that doesn't execute the boot0 code first. So zero page $31 is never set, so the RWTS is looking for the wrong epilogue bytes, so every single disk read fails.</p>
    <p>At this point, I could try to hack the RWTS even further to get it to work under Advanced Demuffin, but I'm wary of this code and don't know what other tricks are up its sleeve. So I'm going to backtrack and take a different approach.</p>
    <p>My initial (manual) inspection of the original disk in the Copy ][+ nibble editor revealed a definite pattern to the address prologue sequences. Even tracks (including track 0) use the standard prologue, "D5 AA 96"; odd tracks (starting with track 1) use "D4 AA 96" instead. As it happens, Advanced</p>
    <p>Demuffin has an option I've never changed before, a track increment value. It defaults to 1 to convert every track, but I could easily change it to 2 to convert every other track. Furthermore, I can control the start and end tracks. So I can convert this disk in two passes. The first pass will copy the even tracks, and the second pass will copy the odd tracks.</p>
    <p>Using a freshly formatted ProntoDOS disk, I'll manually create an RWTS file for the even tracks, and another RWTS file for the odd tracks.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S6D1=ProntoDOS disk]

    </div>
    <p>Both RWTS files will ignore epilogue sequences. (I'm not sure if this is necessary, but it doesn't hurt and I'm already highly suspicious of this disk.) The second RWTS uses a modified address prologue sequence that matches the odd tracks of the original disk.</p>

    <p>The program runs without complaint.</p>
    <p>There doesn't appear to be any secondary protection.</p>
    <p>Of course, my copy still has a custom RWTS that expects every odd track to use a non-standard address prologue.</p>
    <p>But I don't care about that RWTS anymore. I have all the data I need.</p>
    <p>I've confirmed that further all disk access is funneled through DOS. (It even runs from drive 2!) So screw that RWTS. It's caused enough problems.</p>
    <p>Using that freshly formatted ProntoDOS disk from earlier, I call upon the ever-useful Copy ][+ "copy DOS" feature to copy tracks 0-2 of ProntoDOS onto my copy of To Kill A Mockingbird. Now the disk can read itself, and life is good.</p>
