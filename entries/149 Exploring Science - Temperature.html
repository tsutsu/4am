    <p>"Exploring Science: Temperature" is a 1988 educational program by Leslie</p>
    <p>Eiser and Dominique Allard, and distributed by Sunburst Communications.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives read errors on tracks $13 and up. Oddly, when I look at the original disk with the Copy ][+ nibble editor, those "unreadable" tracks do appear to be formatted and to contain data. Needless to say, the copy does not work.</p>
    <p class="seen">Further inspection in the nibble editor reveals that each track has a different address and data prologue:</p>
    <p class="seen">Track | Address | Data ------+----------+----------</p>
    <p class="seen">$00 | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD (normal) $01 | D5 AA 97 | D5 AA AE $02 | D5 AA 9A | D5 AA AF $03 | D5 AA 9B | D5 AA B2 $04 | D5 AA 9D | D5 AA B3</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk runs a program I call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing. For disks that use an entirely custom boot process, AUTOTRACE just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For "DOS 3.3-shaped" disks, which load in the more-or-less the same way as an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it can also capture the next stage of the boot process (to a file called "BOOT1"). "BOOT1" is usually sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are usually loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. (Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.)</p>
    <p class="seen">If the boot1 code is "DOS 3.3-shaped," there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3. In this case, the RWTS was close enough to normal for my AUTOTRACE program (which spot-checks a few locations in memory to guess at its "normalcy"), so it extracted the RWTS routines from $B800..$BFFF and saved them into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format.</p>

    <p>Grr. Track $11 is generally the VTOC (a.k.a. disk catalog), and this disk has one sector that even the original RWTS can't read. Either I'm incredibly unlucky and got a bad original disk, or there's a secondary protection (nibble check) that reads that sector in a further non-standard way, or it's simply unused and is intentionally bad to make my life more difficult. The original disk has no problem booting or loading, so I'm guessing it's either a nibble check or an intentional glitch.</p>
    <p>The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any other track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin.</p>
    <p class="seen">Every disk must be able to read itself.</p>
    <p class="seen">So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">Rebooting my work disk, I can now see the catalog on the demuffin'd copy.</p>

    <p>This is encouraging, because it means that T11,S0F (the unreadable sector) is not used by the disk catalog.</p>

    <p>Hmm, no dice. There may be some DOS-level customizations that the programs rely on. (It didn't work from drive 1, either.) Or maybe it just doesn't like Diversi-DOS.</p>

    <p>OK, that does work. Good. That tells me that there aren't any callbacks in the program itself that are looking for a custom DOS. (I've seen several titles like this from other publishers. They PEEK or CALL specific locations that are intentionally different from standard DOS and reboot if things look amiss.)</p>
    <p>I've cracked a number of Sunburst disks like this one. I've always gotten to this stage -- having converted the disk and confirmed that it works under standard DOS 3.3 -- then replaced tracks 0-2 with standard DOS 3.3 and declared victory. But I've never dug into the custom RWTS itself to see how it works.</p>
    <p>For example, that table of non-standard address and data prologues, where every single track uses different parameters?</p>
    <p>That's unique to Sunburst. I've never seen anything like it anywhere else.</p>
    <p>Something somewhere is changing the RWTS on the fly with every disk read.</p>
    <p>Anyway, partly because I'm curious and partly because I wanted to test my new</p>
    <p>Post-Demuffin Patcher utility (more on that in a minute), I decided to dig into the custom RWTS on this disk. Is there a small set of changes I could make to get my demuffin'd copy to run?</p>
    <p>Or do I really need to just wipe the entire DOS and replace it?</p>

    <p>The RWTS is certainly shaped like a standard DOS 3.3 RWTS. Here's the code at $B94F, which is identical to the code I would find there on a freshly formatted DOS 3.3. (This is where it looks for the address prologue.)</p>

    <p>But as I saw in the nibble editor, each track uses a different value for the third byte in the address prologue.</p>
    <p>Track 0 is the normal "D5 AA 96", but track 1 uses "D5 AA 97", track 2 uses "D5 AA 9A", &c. The code listed above will only read track 0. Something must be changing the value at $B96A before this code is run.</p>
    <p>Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I search for the hex sequence "6A B9" and find one match on T00,S04.</p>
    <p>That sector is loaded at $BA00.</p>

    <p>In case you have no idea what's going on here (I've never seen anything like it)... The table from $BFB8..$BFC7 maps physical to logical sectors. (There's an identical table on T00,S00, but it's only used by boot0 for loading boot1.</p>
    <p>This one is used by the RWTS for the lifetime of the disk.) Anyway, this code is changing that table based on the track number. So, on track $11 (and only track $11), physical sector $08 is treated as sector $02. On all other tracks, physical sector $08 is treated as sector $0E.</p>
    <p>No, I don't know why, except f--- you, that's why.</p>
    <p>At any rate, this confirms my theory that there's some track-based lookup table being used to modify the expected address and data prologues on each track. Fun(*) fact: the table at $BA29 is part of the denibblization process that turns raw nibbles on disk into values in memory, and vice-versa. So they didn't need to "waste" 35 bytes to store custom address prologues for each track; they re-used a table that the RWTS uses for an entirely different purpose -- and one that comprises valid raw nibbles.</p>
    <p>(*) not guaranteed, actual fun may vary</p>
    <p>Turning back to Disk Fixer, I searched for "20 69 BA" (JSR $BA69) and found nothing. But searching for "4C 69 BA" (JMP $BA69) got two matches: one on T00,S00 and one on T00,S08. The one on T00,S08 looks more promising. That sector is loaded at $BE00.</p>
    <p>"Beneath Apple DOS" (p. 8-39) says that the routine at $BE5A is "MYSEEK", and that it is called immediately before the RWTS moves the drive head to the appropriate track in preparation for a read or write. Furthermore, my sector search found the JMP instruction at $BE8B, which (according to "Beneath</p>
    <p>Apple DOS") is the final instruction of the "MYSEEK" routine.</p>
    <p>Looking at a freshly formatted DOS 3.3 disk, it appears that the proper JMP is to $B9A0, which (not coincidentally) is the final instruction of the custom routine at $BA69, after it restores all registers and flags:</p>
    <div class="listing">

    <p>T00,S08,$8C change 69BA to A0B9</p>
    <p>But wait, there's more! I also spotted this difference, in the beginning of the routine to write the address field:</p>

    <p>On a normal DOS 3.3 disk, the code at $BC69 and $BC6C looks like this:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>BC69-   20 C3 BC    JSR   $BCC3
BC6C-   20 C3 BC    JSR   $BCC3</code>
    </div>
    <p>$BCC3 is just an "RTS" instruction. The entire thing is a precise wait loop to write out self-sync bytes ($FF) before the address field. JSR always takes 6 cycles, and RTS also always takes 6 cycles. So the two instructions wait a total of 24 cycles before the "STA $C08D,X" instruction writes the sync byte to disk.</p>
    <p>So what's at $B6B8?</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>*B6B8L
                                cycles

B6C6-   4C 6F BC    JMP   $BC6F ; 3</code>
    </div>
    <p>(*) The Y register is 6 the first time through this loop, so the branch at $B6BC will be taken the first two times, then not taken afterwards. When the branch is taken, it requires 3 CPU cycles and continues at $B6C4, so the total time is 2+2+3+3+3=13 cycles. When that branch is not taken, it requires 2 CPU cycles, falls through to $B6BE, and the whole thing takes 2+2+2+2+2+3+2+3+3=21 cycles. Adding 3 for the initial JMP at $BC69, the whole thing (starting at $BC69, up to but not including the STA at $BC6F) burns either 16 or 24 cycles.</p>
    <p>Low-level disk activity is highly dependent on cycle-accurate counting (since the physical floppy disk keeps spinning whether you write to it or not). In a normal DOS, this wait routine (two consecutive JSR and RTS instructions) always burns exactly 24 cycles. On these disks, it sometimes burns 16 cycles, sometimes 24. So this RWTS writes the first 2 sync bytes faster than usual, then 4 sync bytes at the usual speed.</p>
    <p>Also, the first two times, it writes $00 instead of $FF. I have no idea what effect that has on a physical floppy disk. All valid nibbles have the high bit set, so maybe it's just dead space?</p>
    <p>The entire thing is weird.</p>
    <p>This patch should restore the original wait loop code at $BC69:</p>
    <p>T00,S06,$69 change 4CB8B6EAEAEA</p>
    <p>to 20C3BC20C3BC</p>
    <p>All the other differences in this RWTS center around the address and data prologue and epilogue bytes. The RWTS apparently only uses a single epilogue byte ($97), so some of the branch instructions are subtly different. For example, checking the address epilogue:</p>

    <p>All told, the RWTS needed 15 patches (including the two I mentioned already, and the three listed above) to be able to read and write a standard disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">A lot of disks need this sort of post- demuffin patching, and I got tired of doing it manually, so I wrote a program to do it for me. It is called, unsurprisingly, Post-Demuffin Patcher.</p>
    <p class="seen">It prompts you to select a slot and drive, then reads the demuffin'd disk, checks for a modified DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS, and applies the necessary patches so the disk can read itself. (It can also detect and bypass some nibble checks.) I've included a copy of Post-</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin Patcher on my work disk; the full source code is currently available at <https://archive.org/details/ PostDemuffinPatcher4am>.</p>
    <p>Having already seen several Sunburst disks with identical protection, I knew it would be worth my time to add the detection and repair functions for this crazy RWTS to Post-Demuffin Patcher. So that's exactly what I did.</p>

    <p class="seen">(This is the actual output of the program. Post-Demuffin Patcher prints out the changes it is going to make before it writes them to the disk.)</p>
    <p>The first 2 lines are fixing the non- standard branch instructions around the second epilogue byte. The next 2 lines are the 2 patches I found earlier. The rest are single-byte patches to get the RWTS to read and write a standard disk with "D5 AA 96"/"D5 AA AD" prologues and "DE AA EB" epilogues.</p>
    <p class="seen">I should point out that Post-Demuffin</p>
    <p>Patcher is really quite conservative in making patches. It checks a lot of the surrounding code before deciding to patch a specific location (like the RWTS patches). In the case of changing the JMP at $BE8C from $BA69 to $B9A0, it actually checks every single byte of code at $BA69 to ensure that it recognizes the custom routine as the</p>
    <p>Sunburst RWTS. And there were dozens of patches that it didn't make to this disk, because it decided they weren't needed or it wasn't 100% sure what was going on.</p>

  <h2>POSTSCRIPT</h2>

    <p>Hey, what about that unreadable sector (T11,S0F)? It turns out it's never used. Looking at the VTOC with a sector editor confirms that T11,S00 points to T11,S0D as the first sector of the disk catalog.</p>
