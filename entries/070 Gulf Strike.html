    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy does not work; it just hangs on boot.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to enter the Sector</p>
    <p class="seen">Editor Patcher, then I select "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" to see if I can read the sector data by ignoring address and data epilogues. That works for sectors 0-9 on track 0. Beyond that, things get weird. Pressing "P" again, I select "CUSTOM", then turn off the checksum of the data field. Now I can read the sectors on the rest of the tracks... but they're all garbage. Like they're encrypted or something.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks (like this one, apparently), it just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops. For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800.. $BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS". There's a good chance I'll be able to load that "RWTS" file into a tool called Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. In this case, it stopped after capturing T00,S00. So I need to look at that sector and figure out why.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="seen">Everything here looks pretty normal (i.e. just like an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk), until it goes to jump to the boot1 code. Usually that happens with an indirect JMP ($08FD), which, in a normal boot0, will end up continuing execution at $B700 which is stored in track 0, sector 1. But in this case, I see:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>084A-   6C FE BB    JMP   ($BBFE)</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Highly suspect. I definitely want to see what evil lurks at whatever address $BBFE is pointing to. That area of memory is normally reserved for the denibblizing process when reading data from a sector. It's scratch space, essentially. It's overwritten every time the disk reads itself (after boot1 is loaded).</p>
    <p class="seen">But $BBFE isn't loaded yet, because I interrupted the boot process before it could be loaded. So now I need to trace the boot again, but a little bit further -- far enough for boot0 to load boot1 (including the suspicious pointer at $BBFE), but no further.</p>
    <p class="seen">My work disk has another program, unimaginatively named AUTOTRACE1, which does just that. It loads track 0, sector 0, then patches the boot0 code at $084A to call back to a routine under my control (instead of jumping to the original disk's boot1 code).</p>

    <p class="seen">The important takeaway here is that there don't appear to be any long-term side effects to this copy protection.</p>
    <p class="seen">If it succeeds, it restores everything that it modified (in the RWTS code), then it just jumps to $B700 to start the boot1 phase. But that's it; nothing else seems to rely on some magic number that it pulls from the raw nibbles or anything. It doesn't decrypt anything.</p>
    <p class="seen">It doesn't even clear the carry flag.</p>
    <p class="seen">With that knowledge, I can safely ignore it and focus on getting the disk decrypted and into a standard format, using Advanced Demuffin and the "RWTS" file that my AUTOTRACE1 program saved.</p>
