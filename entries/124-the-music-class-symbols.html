    <p>"The Music Class: Symbols" is a 1985 educational program by Frank Bradshaw and Virgil Hicks and distributed by</p>
    <p>Wenger Corporation. My originals say "Version 2.10" on the outside label and on the title screen.</p>
    <p class="seen">The program comes on two double-sided disks. All sides are bootable, and each is independent of the others.</p>
    <p>- Disk 1: "Music Box I"</p>
    <p>- Disk 2: "Music Box II"</p>
    <p>- Disk 3: "Music Box Tool Kit"</p>
    <p>- Disk 4: "Music Box Tool Kit"</p>
    <p class="seen">The program appears to be Apple</p>
    <p class="seen">Pascal-based. The boot sequence has that distinctive Pascal smell: several sequential track reads, filling the screen with null bytes, switching to 80 column mode, clearing the screen, showing the block cursor in the upper left corner. I even recognize the font on the graphical title screen; they're calling the WSTRING function in the standard TURTLEGRAPHICS unit.</p>
    <p class="seen">Anyway, COPYA fails immediately and miserably on all disks. Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to get to the Sector Editor Patcher and select "DOS 3.3 PATCHED". This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences. As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD"), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p class="seen">So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Given that this disk is Pascal- based, my AUTOTRACE program will be essentially useless. (Note to self: extend AUTOTRACE to extract the RWTS from Pascal and ProDOS disks.)</p>
    <p class="seen">The Copy ][+ nibble editor confirms the standard address and data prologues, but the address epilogue is "DE DE". ("DE AA" is the standard.) Further inspection suggests that every track uses the same encoding.</p>
    <p class="seen">It's time for Super Demuffin.</p>
    <p class="seen">Super Demuffin is a utility built on top of Locksmith Fast Disk Copy. It takes a disk that uses non-standard but uniform structure, and it converts it to a standard disk format. I've included a copy on my work disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">When you first run Super Demuffin, it asks for the parameters of the original disk. In this case, the prologue bytes are the same, but the address epilogue uses "DE DE" instead of "DE AA". I just need to change that parameter (shown below).</p>

    <p class="seen">(All four disks have the same non- standard epilogue bytes, so I repeat this procedure for each disk.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I have a copy of each disk in a standard format that can be read by any third-party tool. That is, I can copy these disks with COPYA or Locksmith</p>
    <p class="seen">Fast Disk Backup, without patching the DOS 3.3 RWTS beforehand. I can sector edit the disk without messing with the</p>
    <p class="seen">Sector Editor Patcher. &c.</p>
    <p class="seen">Depending on how the original RWTS was written, a demuffin'd disk may not be able to read itself. Sometimes when a disk is authored with non-standard epilogue bytes, the developers just patch the RWTS to ignore epilogue bytes, while others patch the RWTS to look for specific non-standard epilogue bytes. Demuffin'd disks in the latter category will grind almost immediately on boot, since as soon as the RWTS is loaded, all further disk reads will demand the original (non-standard) epilogue bytes and not find them.</p>
    <p class="seen">Booting the demuffin'd disk confirms that this disk is in the latter category; it starts grinding almost immediately.</p>
    <p class="seen">I'm not terribly familiar with the layout of Apple Pascal disks, but I do know that RWTS code is almost always on track 0. So I put my demuffin'd disk 1 into slot 6, drive 1, fired up my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, and disassembled every sector in track 0 until I found it.</p>
    <p>The relevant snippet (on T00,S0D) looks like this:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>SECTOR EDITOR                   DRIVE 1</code>

    </div>
    <p class="seen">(That second "CMP #$DE" should be $AA.)</p>
    <p class="seen">T00,S0D,$51 change "DE" to "AA"</p>
    <p class="seen">Now my copy of disk 1 boots for a little while, but then it starts grinding again, and eventually it asks me to insert the boot disk with SYSTEM.PASCAL on it.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are *two* RWTS's on this disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?</p>
    <p class="seen">I don't even know where to start looking for the second one. Or do I?</p>
    <p class="seen">The entire disk uses the same non- standard epilogue bytes ("DE DE"). If I do a sector search for "C9 DE", maybe</p>
    <p class="seen">I'll get lucky.</p>
    <p class="seen">Mirabile dictu! There are three hits, and all of them are part of the second RWTS. The first two are looking for the first epilogue byte (presumably one is for the address epilogue and the other for the data epilogue). That's supposed to be $DE, so I won't change those. The third match is the one I want. The code listing is almost identical to the one I found on T00,S0D, so I won't list it here.</p>
    <p>T09,S0A,$7B change "DE" to "AA"</p>
    <p class="seen">Success! The program boots and runs without complaint. There doesn't appear to be any further copy protection beyond the custom disk structure.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now, what about the other three disks?</p>
    <p class="seen">Each is bootable, which means it has its own RWTS on track 0, and each is independent, which means it has its own</p>
    <p class="seen">Pascal SYSTEM files. Each disk was authored with the same non-standard epilogue bytes. But I think the second RWTS is part of a file, because it's in a different sector on each disk. A sector search for "C9 DE" lets me zero in on them.</p>
    <p class="seen">Disk 2:</p>
    <p>T00,S0D,$51 change "DE" to "AA" T08,S0A,$7B change "DE" to "AA"</p>
