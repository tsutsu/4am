"Piece of Cake" and "Piece of Cake
Math," which were distributed by
Springboard Software. Which is
interesting, because AFAIK those were
two unrelated companies. This write-up
is therefore quite similar to that one,

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format. (It uses the disk's own RWTS to read the original, then a standard DOS 3.3- compatible RWTS to write out the data, sector by sector.)</p>
    <p class="seen">But wait, there's more! The latest feature I added to my AUTOTRACE program is automatic IOB module creation. What the heck is an IOB module? Well, the author of Advanced Demuffin anticipated that he couldn't anticipate everything, so he made the program extensible.</p>
    <p class="seen">Quoting from the Advanced Demuffin softdocs (included on my work disk):</p>
    <div class="curses">
      <code>An IOB module is an interface for the
source RWTS. Advanced Demuffin uses the
IOB module to set up the IOB table and
jump to RWTS.  The IOB module is stored
from $1400-$14FB. When Advanced
Demuffin loads in a IOB module, it
reads the first sector of the file off
the track-sector list and stores it at
$13FC-$14FB. When Advanced Demuffin
wants to read a sector it JSRs to the
IOB module with the phase number,
sector number, and the page number
stored in the A, Y and X registers
respectively. Since the source drive
always has to be drive one, Advanced
Demuffin can make the IOB module very
compact. After it gets the page,track
and sector Advanced Demuffin sets up
the IOB for RWTS using this infor-
mation, and JMPs to RWTS. (It jumps
instead of JSRing, because it lets the
RWTS do the RTS.) Here is a list of the
IOB module that is built in to Advanced
Demuffin:</code>

      <p class="comment">One problem with having an RWTS at $3800..$3FFF is that that range is normally used to store track data during the copy process. If we just let Advanced Demuffin run, it will overwrite the custom RWTS almost immediately and crash. In the ADVANCED DEMUFFIN TECH NOTES (also included on my work disk), the author mentions that you can control how many sectors Advanced Demuffin reads at a time, and where it puts it in memory. Normally $1CF0 is $20 and $1CF1 is $90, meaning that it will copy 7 tracks worth of data at a time into $2000..$8FFF. Changing the end parameter to $30 will only copy one track at a time, but has the distinct advantage of not overwriting the RWTS and crashing.</p>

    <p>Gah. I'm so comfortable tracing boot1 code in the $B700 range. But this... this is like waking up in a parallel universe where everything is just slightly different and Robin Williams is still alive. Anyway, this is all bog standard so far. $3793 is the multi-sector read routine that reads the rest of DOS backwards starting at T02,S04. The RWTS parameter table starts at $37E8.</p>

    <p class="seen">That last line looks suspicious, but it's actually not. So far, this code is identical to the DOS 3.3 master disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">The routine at $1B03 is what figures out how much memory there is and moves DOS as high as possible.</p>
    <p class="seen">It makes sense that I haven't found anything unusual yet. Evidence so far suggests that the RWTS on disk can read tracks 0-2 (which is where it's loading DOS), then it switches to a different RWTS that can read the rest of the disk. So whatever this disk is doing to modify its RWTS or load a new one, it's going to do it after loading DOS. And I need to find out where.</p>
    <p class="seen">But that means I need to trace the boot even further.</p>
