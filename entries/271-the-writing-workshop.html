    <p>I have 12 disks. They are not numbered.</p>
    <p>Five explicitly state on the disk label that they are "copyable for classroom use." None of those five are bootable (beyond a message saying they are a data disk of some sort). On the bright side, I successfully copied each of them with COPYA.</p>
    <p>- File Cabinet Diskette 1 - File Cabinet Diskette 2 - Help Files - Mechanics Checker II (Word List) - Spelling Checker II (Word List)</p>
    <p>The other seven disks are bootable and,</p>
    <p>I'm assuming, copy-protected:</p>
    <p>- The Milliken Word Processor - Brainstorming - Branching - Nutshelling - Mechanics Checker I (Driver) - Spelling Checker I (Driver) - Proofreader</p>
    <p>Each disk appears to be independent of the others. To use a different part of the program, you are expected to reboot with the appropriate disk.</p>
    <p>I'll start with "The Milliken Word</p>
    <p>Processor."</p>

  <h3>Hide Your Disk Catalog With This One Weird Trick! Crackers Hate It!</h3>

    <p>The demuffin'd copy ought to have a catalog (I saw it on the original disk with Disk Fixer), but now it has suspiciously vanished.</p>
    <p>Turning again to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I see the problem. Track $11 does have a catalog, but the pointer to the first directory sector has been intentionally corrupted.</p>

But how does the original disk know? I scoured "Beneath Apple DOS" until I found the answer on page 8-28:</p>

; If first, get track/sector of
  directory sector from VTOC at offset
  +1,+2.
; Otherwise, get track/sector from
  directory sector at offset +1,+2. If
  track is zero, exit with error code
  (end of directory).
; Call RWTS to read sector.

    <p class="seen">So, to read the first sector of file names and other metadata, this routine is supposed to look at the VTOC sector buffer (read from T11,S00 and stored at $B3BB..$B4BA).

  <h3>In Which We Walk The Fine Line Between Bullshit and Misdirection</h3>

    <p>I should note at this point that my copy is actually a disk image being managed by a CFFA3000 card. I sector- copied the disk image back to a physical floppy and booted it, and it displayed the behavior I was expecting (load DOS, print ".", then reboot -- just like my failed bit copy). Then I copied the disk image to a modern PC and ran it in two different emulators; each time, it gave me the message about the drive operating at an unsafe speed.</p>
    <p class="seen">I'm about to give up on this DOS and just blow it away and replace it with a fresh copy of DOS 3.3. I've already confirmed that the program itself loads when I boot from my work disk. But now</p>
    <p class="seen">I want to know whether this DOS is really checking the drive speed, or if that's just bullshit and misdirection.</p>

It really is using a timing loop and repeated sector reads to check the drive speed. The fact that it fails under emulation is a result of imperfect emulation, not any malice on the part of the author. He honestly cares about my drive speed. He never even gets as far as checking if my disk is original.</p>

    <p>On further reflection, it occurs to me that the drive speed check was added because the copy protection was fragile and failed if the disk speed was off (even on original disks where it was supposed to pass). So it's technically accurate to say that the drive speed is off, but it's still misdirection. (And the part about destroying the program is just bullshit; drives don't work like that.) The program itself works fine; all access is through standard DOS 3.3 calls, and DOS is very tolerant of minor drive variations. The only thing that can't handle it is the copy protection. But rather than fix that (or, you know, give up on the idea of copy protection altogether), they added a layer of bullshit on top of it.</p>
    <p>Anyway, there are no side effects to this copy protection. If it succeeds, it jumps to $9D84 as usual. That means</p>
    <p>I can safely bypass the entire thing by changing the JMP that started it all, at $B747.</p>
    <p class="seen">T00,S01,$48 change "03 9B" to "84 9D"</p>
    <p>All seven protected disks use identical protection. The RWTS I captured from this disk also works to convert the other six. They each have an unreadable T02,S05; they each need their RWTS patched to read standard epilogue bytes; they each call $9B03 instead of $9D84.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <h3>In Which All Copies Are Protected, But Some Are More Protected Than Others</h3>

    <p>Here's what worries me: these programs deal with data disks (to store your own documents or read the word list disks or other disks labeled "copyable for classroom use"). Those disks are unprotected. Some disks deal with this by using a flexible RWTS that can read and write the standard and non-standard RWTS. But this disk is not doing that.</p>
    <p>Its RWTS is strict -- remember, I had to patch it just to get it to boot far enough to call its nibble check (which failed, but we're past that now).</p>
    <p>That means that something, somewhere, is fiddling with the RWTS at runtime.</p>
    <p>According to my handy dandy RWTS chart, there are four memory addresses that correspond to the four patches I made on disk to get the RWTS to read a standardized disk:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>  $B89E (T00,S02,$9E)
  $B935 (T00,S03,$35)
  $B991 (T00,S03,$91)
  $BCAE (T00,S06,$AE)</code>
    </div>
    <p>Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I searched for "35 B9" (one of the RWTS epilogue bytes) and found two matches. Both look like this:</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>T12,S0E
----------- DISASSEMBLY MODE ----------
000E:A9 DE          LDA   #$DE
0010:8D 9E B8       STA   $B89E
0013:8D 35 B9       STA   $B935
0016:8D 91 B9       STA   $B991
0019:8D AE BC       STA   $BCAE

0022:2C 50 C0       BIT   $C050
0025:2C 52 C0       BIT   $C052</code>
    </div>
    <p>That's "resetting" the RWTS to standard values after the program is loaded into memory, so it can read and write from the data disk. That's OK; it's already standard values on my copy, but setting it again won't hurt anything. I found similar code on each of the seven protected disks. But on some of them, I also found a different pattern:</p>
    <p>T12,S0D ("Brainstorming" disk) ----------- DISASSEMBLY MODE ---------- 00CB:A0 00 LDY #$00 00CD:EE 9E B8 INC $B89E <-- ! 00D0:EE 35 B9 INC $B935 <-- ! 00D3:EE 91 B9 INC $B991 <-- ! 00D6:EE AE BC INC $BCAE <-- ! 00D9:20 0C 40 JSR $400C 00DC:CE 9E B8 DEC $B89E <-- ! 00DF:CE 35 B9 DEC $B935 <-- ! 00E2:CE 91 B9 DEC $B991 <-- ! 00E5:CE AE BC DEC $BCAE <-- ! 00E8:A5 F1 LDA $F1 00EA:D0 33 BNE $011F</p>
    <p>That's, um, bad. The INC instructions change the epilogue bytes in memory from the standard $DE to the non- standard $DF. Then the DEC instructions change them back.</p>
    <p>Changing each INC and DEC instruction to a "BIT" will neutralize the RWTS fiddling.</p>

    <p>All other disks appear to be "single load." They load the program into memory, standardize the RWTS in memory, then work solely with data disks until reboot.</p>
