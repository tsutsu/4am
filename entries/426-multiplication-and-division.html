    <p>"Multiplication and Division" is a 1987 educational game distributed by Silver</p>
    <p>Burdett Company.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy it creates only gets as far as loading DOS and displaying the BASIC prompt before crashing into the monitor at address $910A.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I press "O" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Input/Output Control and set "CHECKSUM ENABLED" to "NO". This will ignore the checksum bytes and epilogue sequences. i.e. As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">Track $11 does appear to contain a disk catalog, which strongly suggests this program is file-based.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my limited experience cracking other disks, I would guess that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise a sector editor would give read errors, even when ignoring checksums]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p class="seen">So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Just by looking at the first few sectors, it appears that this disk uses a DOS 3.3-derived RWTS, which means that my AUTOTRACE program should be able to extract the RWTS from the original disk.</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, that worked flawlessly. My work disk first runs AUTOTRACE0, which sets up a minimal boot trace to capture the first sector of track 0 and saves it to the file "BOOT0" (on my work disk, not the original disk). If the first sector looks reasonably normal, it runs AUTOTRACE1, which sets up a more involved boot trace to capture the rest of track 0 and save it to the file "BOOT1". If *that* looks reasonably normal, it saves the RWTS to a file, unimaginatively named "RWTS", which can be loaded with Advanced Demuffin to copy each track of the original disk to a duplicate with standard address/data prologue/epilogue sequences.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original RWTS</p>
    <p class="seen">was written, a demuffin'd disk may not be able to read itself. Some developers just patch the RWTS to ignore epilogue bytes, while others patch the RWTS to look for specific non-standard epilogue bytes.</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin'd disks in the latter category will grind immediately on boot, since as soon as the RWTS is loaded, all further disk reads will look for the original (non-standard) epilogue bytes and not find them.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p>run. The copies I tried to make -- even the bit copies -- just crashed.</p>
    <p>The original disk boots fine, which means there is some code being executed during boot to check if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p class="seen">This disk appears to be in the "strict RWTS" category. My demuffin'd copy just grinds on boot, which tells me that the RWTS is looking for specific (non- standard) epilogue bytes and failing to find them. So I need to patch the RWTS to undo the modifications and look for the standard epilogue bytes instead.</p>
    <p class="seen">For future reference (mostly mine), here's a nice chart of the memory locations for all the prologues and epilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. If the RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (most do), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02; $B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.</p>
    <p class="seen"></p>
    <p class="seen">0x | read | write</p>
    <p class="seen">---------------+-------+------- D5 | $B955 | $BC7A prologue AA | $B95F | $BC7F / 96 | $B96A | $BC84 ADDRESS -------+-------+------- \ DE | $B991 | $BCAE epilogue AA | $B99B | $BCB3 EB | | $BCB8 ---------------+-------+------- D5 | $B8E7 | $B853 prologue AA | $B8F1 | $B858 / AD | $B8FC | $B85D DATA ----------+-------+------- \ DE | $B935 | $B89E epilogue AA | $B93F | $B8A3 EB | | $B8A8 ---------------+-------+-------</p>
    <p class="seen"></p>
    <p class="seen">Here are the patches to normalize the RWTS. (Note to self: make an RWTS comparison tool.)</p>
    <p>T00,S03,$91 change "AB" to "DE" T00,S03,$9B change "FF" to "AA"</p>
    <p>Now my demuffin'd copy boots, loads DOS, displays a prompt, runs a boot program, and... crashes in exactly the same way that my failed bit copy did.</p>

    <p>According to Copy ][+, the boot program on this disk is a binary file called "XMGPRT" that is loaded at $9000. ("CHANGE BOOT PROGRAM" will show the current boot program, even if you don't want to change it. "CATALOG DISK" -> "W/ FILE LENGTHS" will show the start address of each file.)</p>

    <p>Literally, that's it. I'm pretty sure they meant to have an "RTS" here (which would reboot), but they had an off-by-1 bug in saving this file and the "RTS" instruction went missing.</p>

    <p class="seen">Aha! It's not an infinite loop after all. Well, it is, technically, but it won't actually run forever. It's not easy to show in plain text, but the initial "D" and the final "M@" are in inverse. So that string starts with</p>
    <p class="seen">Ctrl-D and ends with Ctrl-M and a null byte. Since DOS is already loaded, printing this through the DOS vector will execute that command, as if you typed it from a prompt yourself. Since that program never returns to the caller, it will break out of the seemingly "infinite" loop.</p>
    <p>Since there are no side effects to the copy protection routine, I can change this file to simply skip over it and go straight to running the real startup program.</p>
