    <p>"Racter" is a 1985 text-based insanity simulation developed by INRAC Corp. and distributed by Mindscape. No one can be told what Racter is; you have to see it for yourself.</p>

      <code>[The copy protection is identical to
"Rambo First Blood Part II," also
distributed by Mindscape. This write-up
is therefore quite similar to that one,
with a few updates because I have more
automated tools now.]</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">The original disk appears to be built on Apple Pascal. At least, the boot process looks like Pascal. It fills the screen with null bytes, then clears the screen and shows a solid cursor, then continues to load the program.</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy just reboots endlessly.</p>
    <p class="seen">In my experience, programs do not spontaneously reboot unless someone tells them to.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I go to "Input/Output Control" (press "O") and set CHECKSUM ENABLED = NO. This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences -- as long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my limited experience cracking other disks, I would guess that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+ sector editor would give read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p class="seen">So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. My AUTOTRACE program will only automate extraction of the RWTS from a DOS 3.3-shaped bootloader, so let's see if I can use Super Demuffin.</p>
    <p class="seen">Super Demuffin is a cracker's utility built on top of Locksmith Fast Disk</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy. It takes a disk that uses non- standard but uniform address and data prologue and epilogue bytes, and it converts it to a standard disk format.</p>
    <p class="seen">I've included a copy on my work disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">First, I'll need to find exactly what those epilogue bytes are. Turning to the Copy ][+ nibble editor:</p>

      <p class="comment">This area is normally not important, so COPYA didn't copy it precisely because normal disks don't care. (Actually, it's even more evil than that, because the original disk is written with timing bits in specific non-standard places between the nibbles in the dead zone. This code not only requires the right nibbles in the right order, it reads them just slightly slower than normal. So the timing bits need to be in the right places too, or else this code will read the wrong nibble values while it's out of sync. This will trip up even the best bit copiers.</p>
      <p class="comment">And you can forget about making a disk image for emulators -- those don't store timing bits at all.)</p>

    <p class="seen">To bypass this, it should be enough to change the original "JSR $0B00" to "STA $0478" (which was the first instruction at $0B00 and is what is usually there in the boot0 code in the first place).</p>

    <p>Patcher is really quite conservative in making patches. It checks a lot of the surrounding code before deciding to patch a specific location. In the case of bypassing this nibble check, it checks every single byte of code up to and including the JSR $0B00, to ensure that the disk is using a known Pascal bootloader up until that point. And there were dozens of patches that it didn't make to this disk (like RWTS patches), because it decided they weren't needed.</p>

    <p class="seen">And it works. The disk boots and runs with no complaint. There doesn't appear to be any further protection. Hooray for automation. (Oh, this is gonna get good.)</p>
