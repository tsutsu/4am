    <p>"Un Dia Tipico" is a 1985 educational game distributed by D.C. Heath & Co.</p>
    <p>Despite the name, the program is primarily in English.</p>
    <p>The original program comes on three single-sided disks. Disk 1 boots, loads DOS, displays a (slightly delayed) BASIC prompt, then runs a HELLO program of some sort. Disk 2 and 3 simply boot to a text message saying "INSERT DISK 1 AND PRESS ANY KEY".</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy grinds the disk drive on boot and never gets any further.</p>
    <p>Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I can read track 0 and every even track without any problem. But the odd-numbered tracks are opaque. If I switch to the nibble editor, it appears that the odd-numbered tracks use a non-standard address prologue, "D4 AA 96" instead of the usual "D5 AA 96".</p>

    </div>
    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks (like this one, apparently), it just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops. For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800.. $BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS". There's a good chance I'll be able to load that "RWTS" file into a tool called Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. In this case, it stopped after capturing T00,S00. So I need to look at that sector and figure out why.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="seen">I've seen a lot of boot0 code from different copy-protected (and not copy-protected) disks, so I've kind of developed a sense of what a "normal" boot looks like. I can look at almost- but-not-quite normal boot0 code and hone in pretty quickly on the part that's unusual. Maybe it calls a subroutine that isn't normally called, or it does things in a strange order, or it jumps to an unusual place after loading the boot1 code.</p>
    <p class="seen">Everything here looks pretty normal (i.e. just like an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk), until it goes to jump to the boot1 code. Usually that happens with an indirect JMP ($08FD), which, in a normal boot0, will end up continuing execution at $B700 which is stored in track 0, sector 1. But in this case, I see:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>084A-   4C 00 BB    JMP   $BB00</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Highly suspect. I definitely want to see what evil lurks at $BB00. That area of memory is normally reserved for the denibblizing process when reading data from a sector. It's scratch space, essentially. It's overwritten every time the disk reads itself (after boot1 is loaded).</p>
    <p class="seen">But $BB00 isn't loaded yet, because I interrupted the boot process before it could be loaded. So now I need to trace the boot again, but a little bit further -- far enough for boot0 to load boot1 (including the suspicious code at $BB00), but no further.</p>
    <p class="seen">My work disk has another program, unimaginatively named AUTOTRACE1, which does just that. It loads track 0, sector 0, then patches the boot0 code at $084A to call back to a routine under my control (instead of jumping to the original disk's boot1 code). The only reason it didn't run already is that the instruction at $084A is non- standard. But the boot0 code is close enough to standard that AUTOTRACE1 should be able to patch it. (I mean, we *are* patching assembly language code here. There's a very low tolerance for error.)</p>

    <p class="seen">Well, that worked flawlessly. Not only did I get the rest of the boot1 code, but the RWTS is apparently in as standard location too. So before I investigate the nibble check at $BB00,</p>
    <p class="seen">I'm going to load that RWTS into</p>

    <p class="seen">Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot 5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppy disks like some kind of 20th century peasant.</p>

    <p class="seen">This RWTS is doing something sneaky to make my job harder: it's putting one of the epilogue bytes into a zero page address, then reading the value from there instead of using a constant.</p>
    <p class="seen">Why? Because f--- you, that's why.</p>
    <p class="seen">Because it makes the extracted RWTS useless without initializing the magic zero page location with the right magic number. Automated RWTS extraction programs wouldn't find this (as I just saw when Advanced Demuffin failed to read the original disk with the RWTS from the original disk). Everything is a countermeasure to something.</p>
    <p class="seen">This calls for an IOB module.</p>
    <p class="seen">What's an IOB module? Well, the author of Advanced Demuffin anticipated that he couldn't anticipate everything, so he made the program extensible. Quoting from the Advanced Demuffin softdocs (included on my work disk):</p>
    <div class="curses">
      <code>An IOB module is an interface for the
source RWTS. Advanced Demuffin uses the
IOB module to set up the IOB table and
jump to RWTS.  The IOB module is stored
from $1400-$14FB. When Advanced
Demuffin loads in a IOB module, it
reads the first sector of the file off
the track-sector list and stores it at
$13FC-$14FB. When Advanced Demuffin
wants to read a sector it JSRs to the
IOB module with the phase number,
sector number, and the page number
stored in the A, Y and X registers
respectively. Since the source drive
always has to be drive one, Advanced
Demuffin can make the IOB module very
compact. After it gets the page,track
and sector Advanced Demuffin sets up
the IOB for RWTS using this infor-
mation, and JMPs to RWTS. (It jumps
instead of JSRing, because it lets the
RWTS do the RTS.) Here is a list of the
IOB module that is built in to Advanced
Demuffin:</code>
