    <p>The main menu says "Ver 3.0 04-01-82".</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails immediately and miserably. 4 bit copy gives no errors, and the copy works, which suggests that this disk may not use any secondary protection beyond the non-standard disk structure. (I have seem some weaker nibble checks that can be defeated with a strong bit copier, so you never know until you try.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Sector Editor Patcher, and select "DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 PATCHED". This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences.</p>
    <p class="seen">As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p>The Copy ][+ nibble editor also shows standard address and data prologues, but a non-standard address epilogue of "DA AA CF" (instead of "DE AA EB") and a non-standard data epilogue of "DA AA EB" (instead of "DE AA EB").</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">Depending on how the original RWTS was written, a demuffin'd disk may not be able to read itself. Some developers just patch the RWTS to ignore epilogue bytes, while others patch the RWTS to look for specific non-standard epilogue bytes. Demuffin'd disks in the latter category will grind immediately on boot, since as soon as the RWTS is loaded, all further disk reads will look for the original (non-standard) epilogue bytes and not find them.</p>
    <p class="seen">Booting the demuffin'd copy confirms that this disk is in the latter category: it grinds almost immediately on boot, unable to read itself.</p>
    <p class="seen">For future reference (mostly mine), here's a nice chart of the memory locations for all the prologues and epilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. If the RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (most do), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02; $B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.</p>

    <p class="seen">I spent way too much time making that.</p>
    <p>Anyway, here are the three patches that allow my copy to read itself.</p>
    <p>T00,S02,$9E change "DA" to "DE" T00,S03,$35 change "DA" to "DE" T00,S03,$91 change "DA" to "DE"</p>
    <p>(The third byte of the address epilogue is never checked, so the fact that it was non-standard doesn't actually matter.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Success! The disk boots and loads with no complaint. There doesn't appear to be any secondary protection.</p>
    <p class="seen">Quod erat liberandum.</p>
