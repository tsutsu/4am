    <p>"MatchMaker Dictionary" is a 1983 educational game distributed by MatchMaker, Inc.</p>
    <p>COPYA fails immediately and miserably. EDD 4 bit copy gives no errors, and the copy works, which suggests that this disk may not use any secondary protection beyond the non-standard disk structure. (I have seem some weaker nibble checks that can be defeated with a strong bit copier, so you never know until you try.)</p>
    <p>Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I go to "Input/Output Control" (press "O") and set CHECKSUM ENABLED = NO. This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences -- as long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. So no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Let's see if AUTOTRACE can capture the RWTS from the original disk. If not, I'll have to resort to manual investigation.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p>Now I use plug that RWTS file into</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin and try to convert the data on this disk to a standard format.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>

    <p>The program loads and runs without complaint.</p>
    <p class="seen">Depending on how the original RWTS was written, a demuffin'd disk may not be able to read itself. Some developers just patch the RWTS to ignore epilogue bytes, while others patch the RWTS to look for specific non-standard epilogue bytes. Demuffin'd disks in the latter category will grind immediately on boot, since as soon as the RWTS is loaded, all further disk reads will look for the original (non-standard) epilogue bytes and not find them.</p>
    <p class="seen">Booting the demuffin'd copy confirms that this disk is in the latter category: it grinds almost immediately on boot, unable to read itself.</p>
    <p class="seen">For future reference (mostly mine), here's a nice chart of the memory locations for all the prologues and epilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. If the RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (most do), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02; $B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.</p>
