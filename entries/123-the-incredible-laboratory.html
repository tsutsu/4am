    <p>"The Incredible Laboratory: Strategies in Problem Solving" is a 1984 educational game distributed by</p>
    <p>Sunburst Communications, Inc. It was programmed by Jay Carlson, with graphics by Melissa Verber.</p>

"M-ss-ng L-nks," also distributed by
Sunburst. This write-up is therefore
quite similar to that one, with a few
corrections.]</code>

    <p class="seen">The original disk is uncopyable by COPYA or Locksmith Fast Disk Backup. EDD 4 bit copy gives read errors on tracks $13 and up. Oddly, when I look at the original disk with the Copy ][+ nibble editor, those "unreadable" tracks do appear to be formatted and to contain data. Needless to say, the copy does not work.</p>
    <p class="seen">Further inspection in the nibble editor reveals that each track has a different address and data prologue:</p>
    <p class="seen">Track | Address | Data ------+----------+----------</p>
    <p class="seen">$00 | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD (normal) $01 | D5 AA 97 | D5 AA AE $02 | D5 AA 9A | D5 AA AF $03 | D5 AA 9B | D5 AA B2 $04 | D5 AA 9D | D5 AA B3</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk runs a program I call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing. For disks that use an entirely custom boot process, AUTOTRACE just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For "DOS 3.3-shaped" disks, which load in the more-or-less the same way as an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it can also capture the next stage of the boot process (to a file called "BOOT1"). "BOOT1" is usually sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are usually loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. (Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.)</p>
    <p class="seen">If the boot1 code is "DOS 3.3-shaped," there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3. In this case, the RWTS was close enough to normal for my AUTOTRACE program (which spot-checks a few locations in memory to guess at its "normalcy"), so it extracted the RWTS routines from $B800..$BFFF and saved them into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>

    <p class="seen">The game loads and runs without complaint. All further disk access is done through standard DOS functions. (It even runs from drive 2!) There doesn't appear to be any kind of nibble check or other copy protection, beyond the custom RWTS.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I need to make my copy bootable.</p>
    <p class="seen">Remember, it still has the original RWTS on it. Advanced Demuffin does not do any post-conversion patching, so it often leaves you with a disk that can't read itself.</p>
    <p class="seen">Since I've confirmed that this disk has a standard DOS 3.3 disk catalog and can be run from my work disk, I'm just going to blow away the entire DOS and replace it with an unmodified DOS 3.3.</p>
