    <p>"The World's Greatest Baseball Game" is a 1984 sports simulation distributed by</p>
    <p>Epyx.</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy just reboots endlessly.</p>
    <p class="seen">In my experience, programs do not spontaneously reboot unless someone tells them to.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to enter the Sector</p>
    <p class="seen">Editor Patcher, then select "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" (which ignores address field checksums and epilogue bytes). Behold!</p>
    <p class="seen">All tracks and sectors are readable.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my limited experience cracking other disks, I would guess that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+ sector editor would give read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p class="seen">So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p>Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Just by looking at the first few sectors, it appears that this disk uses a DOS 3.3-derived RWTS, which means that my AUTOTRACE program should be able to extract the RWTS from the original disk.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format. (It uses the disk's own RWTS to read the original, then a standard DOS 3.3- compatible RWTS to write out the data, sector by sector.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot 5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppy disks like some kind of 20th century peasant.</p>

    <p>The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. That's the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original disk</p>
    <p class="seen">was written, this copy may or may not be able to read itself. I may need to patch the disk's RWTS to deal with the fact that the disk is now in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p class="seen">run. The copies I tried to make -- even the bit copies -- just rebooted endlessly, which means there is some code being executed during boot to check if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Just by booting the copy, I can rule out problem #1. The disk seems to read itself just fine. It makes it exactly as far as the failed bit copy -- far enough to figure out that it's not an original disk and reboot.</p>

      <p class="comment">Search for a specific sequence of nibbles in the "dead zone" between the address field and data field.</p>
      <p class="comment">This area is normally not important, so COPYA didn't copy it precisely because normal disks don't care. (Actually, it's even more evil than that, because the original disk is written with timing bits in specific non-standard places between the nibbles in the dead zone. This code not only requires the right nibbles in the right order, it reads them just slightly faster than normal. So the timing bits need to be in the right places too, or the disk will get out of sync and read the wrong nibble values. This will trip up even the best bit copiers. And you can forget about making a disk image for emulators -- those don't store timing bits at all.)</p>

    <p>Which gets us all the way back to the branch-if-carry-is-clear at $BB1C.</p>
    <p>So basically, this entire routine is unnecessary. If the nibble check succeeds, it clears the carry ($BBA6) and returns to code that checks if the carry is clear ($BB1C) and if so just returns to the caller ($B700). If the nibble check fails, it sets the carry ($BBAC) and returns to code that is somewhat obfuscated but ends up rebooting (which matches the behavior</p>
    <p>I saw in my failed bit copy).</p>
    <p>The first instruction (at $BB00) is really the code that belongs at $B700, which called this entire mess. So f--- it, let's just restore that instruction and this code will never execute.</p>
