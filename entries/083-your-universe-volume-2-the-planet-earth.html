    <p>"Your Universe Volume 2: The Planet</p>
    <p>Earth" is a 1985 educational game developed by Larry Cunningham, programmed by Alan Biegelman, edited by</p>
    <p>Joseph London, and distributed by Focus</p>
    <p class="seen">Media, Inc.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[The copy protection is identical to
"Who Am I? Birds, Trees, and Flowers,"
also distributed by Focus Media. This
write-up is therefore quite similar to
that one, with a few corrections.]</code>

    <p>The original disk boots, loads DOS, displays a BASIC prompt, then runs a HELLO program of some sort.</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately with a disk read error. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy grinds the disk drive on boot and never gets any further.</p>
    <p class="seen">My trusty Copy ][+ sector editor can read track 0, sectors 0-9 without any trouble. Everything beyond that, even the rest of the sectors on track 0, is unreadable. Ignoring epilogue bytes (press "P" to get to the Sector Editor</p>
    <p class="seen">Patcher, then select "DOS 3.3 PATCHED") makes no difference.</p>
    <p class="seen">Switching to the nibble editor, it appears that all the tracks are in a fairly standard 16-sector format, but the data prologue has been changed from "D5 AA AD" to "D5 AA FF".</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p>But wait, there's more! The latest feature I added to my AUTOTRACE program is automatic IOB module creation. What the heck is an IOB module? Well, the author of Advanced Demuffin anticipated that he couldn't anticipate everything, so he made the program extensible.</p>
    <p>Quoting from the Advanced Demuffin softdocs (included on my work disk):</p>
    <div class="curses">
      <code>An IOB module is an interface for the
source RWTS. Advanced Demuffin uses the
IOB module to set up the IOB table and
jump to RWTS.  The IOB module is stored
from $1400-$14FB. When Advanced
Demuffin loads in a IOB module, it
reads the first sector of the file off
the track-sector list and stores it at
$13FC-$14FB. When Advanced Demuffin
wants to read a sector it JSRs to the
IOB module with the phase number,
sector number, and the page number
stored in the A, Y and X registers
respectively. Since the source drive
always has to be drive one, Advanced
Demuffin can make the IOB module very
compact. After it gets the page,track
and sector Advanced Demuffin sets up
the IOB for RWTS using this infor-
mation, and JMPs to RWTS. (It jumps
instead of JSRing, because it lets the
RWTS do the RTS.) Here is a list of the
IOB module that is built in to Advanced
Demuffin:</code>

    <p class="seen">Basically, Advanced Demuffin only knows how to call a custom RWTS if it</p>
    <p class="seen">1. is loaded at $B800..$BFFF</p>
    <p class="seen">2. uses a standard RWTS parameter table</p>
    <p class="seen">3. has an entry point at $BD00 that</p>
    <p class="seen">takes the address of the parameter tables in A and Y</p>
    <p class="seen">4. doesn't require initialization</p>
    <p>As it turns out, that covers a *lot* of copy protected disks, but it doesn't cover this one because the RWTS on disk is loaded at $3800..$3FFF and has its entry point at $3D00. If I told</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin to load this RWTS at $B800 and call it at $BD00, it would crash quite spectacularly.</p>
    <p>So, I added a check to AUTOTRACE to detect that the RWTS is loaded in a non-standard location (lines 279-300 in the HELLO program on my work disk) and automatically create an IOB file that can tell Advanced Demuffin how to access it. Here's what it looks like:</p>

      <p class="comment">Most of this is identical to the standard IOB module that comes with</p>

      <p class="comment">One problem with having an RWTS at $3800..$3FFF is that that range is normally used to store track data during the copy process. If we just let Advanced Demuffin run, it will overwrite the custom RWTS almost immediately and crash. In the ADVANCED DEMUFFIN TECH NOTES (also included on my work disk), the author mentions that you can control how many sectors Advanced Demuffin reads at a time, and where it puts it in memory. Normally $1CF0 is $20 and $1CF1 is $90, meaning that it will copy 7 tracks worth of data at a time into $2000..$8FFF. Changing the end parameter to $30 will only copy one track at a time, but has the distinct advantage of not overwriting the RWTS and crashing.</p>
      <code>1412-   A9 30       LDA   #$30
1414-   8D F1 1C    STA   $1CF1</code>
      <p class="comment">get the address of the RWTS parameter table at $0F1E and call the RWTS entry point at $3D00 (instead of the usual $BD00)</p>
      <code>1417-   A9 0F       LDA   #$0F
1419-   A0 1E       LDY   #$1E
141B-   4C 00 3D    JMP   $3D00</code>
    </div>
    <p>Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format.</p>
    <p>It uses the disk's own RWTS to read the original (stored in the RWTS file, accessed via the IOB module), then a standard DOS 3.3-compatible RWTS to write out the data, sector by sector.</p>
    <p>Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTS and IOB files from a drive in slot 6, which is annoying since mine is in slot</p>
    <p>5. Note to self: patch that someday. In the meantime, I'm swapping floppy disks like some kind of 16th century monk.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS can't read the first 10 sectors of track 0, but that's to be expected -- they were in a different format than the rest of the disk. What I really care about is the rest of the disk, and that part went flawlessly. That's the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
