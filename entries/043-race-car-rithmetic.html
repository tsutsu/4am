    <p>"Race Car 'Rithmetic" is a 1983 educational game. It was designed by</p>
    <p>June S. Stark and David Flatman at the</p>
    <p>Computer Learning Center for Children, and it was distributed by Unicorn</p>
    <p>Software Company.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[The copy protection is identical to
"Gertrude's Secrets," which is mildly
interesting in that it was distributed
by a different company. This write-up
is therefore quite similar to that one,
with a few corrections.]</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Booting the original disk sounds like a normal DOS 3.3, complete with track seeking to track 2, then 1, then 0, then swinging to the middle of the disk to read the catalog track. It even displays a BASIC prompt during boot, as if it's loading a HELLO program.</p>
    <p>However, the disk is uncopyable by any automated method. COPYA fails instantly. EDD4 bit copy gives read errors on track $13 and up (which appear to be entirely unformatted). The copy that EDD4 creates can boot, but it only gets as far as loading DOS and displaying the BASIC prompt before clearing the screen and rebooting. My trusty Copy ][+ sector editor can read tracks $00 through $12, though, once I change the RWTS option to "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" (which ignores address field checksums and epilogue bytes). Track $11 does appear to contain a disk catalog.</p>
    <p class="seen">My initial hypothesis: 6-2 nibble encoding scheme; custom RWTS with standard prologue bytes ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD") but non-standard epilogue bytes; a CALL in the HELLO program that executes a nibble check.</p>
    <p class="seen">I can use COPYA from the DOS 3.3 master disk to copy the data from the original disk to a blank disk with standard epilogue bytes. By booting the DOS 3.3 master disk and changing $B942 from SEC ($38) to CLC ($18), I can create a "no checksum" RWTS that ignores epilogue bytes on read but respects them on write.</p>
    <p class="seen">I will need to make one additional modification. By default, COPYA copies the entire disk, tracks $00 through $22. There is no option in the UI to change this, so I will need to manually BLOAD COPY.OBJ0 and modify it to stop reading and writing after track $12.</p>

    <p class="seen">This produces a copy that is readable by unmodified DOS 3.3. The copy can even read itself (since the only thing that's changed is the epilogue bytes that it was ignoring in the first place). But it still displays the same behavior as the copy I made with EDD4: it loads DOS, displays the BASIC prompt, then reboots.</p>
    <p class="seen">However, further investigation reveals something very interesting...</p>

    <p class="seen">That means that the last part of my hypothesis was incorrect. Whatever secondary protection causes the copy to reboot is not part of the HELLO program; it's part of the custom DOS.</p>
    <p class="seen">At this point, I can recreate a working copy of the game by initializing another blank disk with DOS 3.3 and copying these files over with a file copier. What about the nibble check?</p>
    <p class="seen">Don't even care.</p>

    <p>I've learned from previous cracks (and from reading "Beneath Apple DOS") that, in a standard DOS-3.3-derived RWTS, the area from $BB00 to $BC55 is overwritten by during every disk read. So why is there executable code there? Let's find out.</p>

    <p>That last section at $0286..$0290 is interesting. After the nibble check passes, it replaces two bytes at $9E4E and $9E4F, then immediately jumps to $9E4D. That implies that this nibble check is called via an unconditional jump, not a JSR. With the Copy ][+ sector editor, I searched the disk for "4C 0C 02" and found one reference on T00,S0B. I wonder if I can just change those two bytes to bypass the nibble check altogether...</p>
    <p class="seen">T00,S0B,$4E: change $0C to $80 T00,S0B,$4F: change $02 to $A1</p>
    <p>Success! The game boots and runs with no complaint.</p>
