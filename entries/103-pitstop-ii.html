    <p>"Pitstop II" is a 1984 racing game developed by Synergistic Software and distributed by Epyx. The title screen credits three people by name: Ivan</p>
    <p>Manley, R. Clardy, and D. Stinnett.</p>

    <p>Which is an interesting discovery in and of itself.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this write-up is quite similar to those, with a few updates and corrections.]</p>
    <p>Booting the disk looks and sounds like a normal DOS 3.3 boot, complete with the drive seeking to track 2, then 1, then 0, then swinging to the middle of the disk to read the catalog track. It even displays a BASIC prompt during boot, as if it's loading a HELLO program.</p>
    <p class="seen">However, the disk is uncopyable by any automated method. COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy it creates only gets as far as loading DOS and displaying the BASIC prompt before filling the screen with garbage and rebooting.</p>
    <p>In my experience, disks do not spontaneously reboot unless someone tells them to.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I press "P" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Sector Editor Patcher, and select "DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 PATCHED". This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences -- as long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">Track $11 does appear to contain a disk catalog, which strongly suggests this program is file-based.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my limited experience cracking other disks, I would guess that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+ sector editor would give read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. There are other tools, like Super Demuffin, that can convert a disk like this (with non-standard epilogue bytes) into a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">It requires figuring out what the actual epilogue bytes are, but it has the advantage of surfacing a read error if the original disk actually has a read error.</p>
    <p class="seen">So... no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Just by looking at the first few sectors, it appears that this disk uses a DOS 3.3-derived RWTS, which means that my AUTOTRACE program should be able to extract the RWTS from the original disk.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks (like this one, apparently), it just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops. For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800.. $BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS". There's a good chance I'll be able to load that "RWTS" file into a tool called Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. In this case, it stopped after capturing T00,S00. So I need to look at that sector and figure out why.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="seen">Everything here looks pretty normal (i.e. just like an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk), until it goes to jump to the boot1 code. Usually that happens with an indirect JMP ($08FD), which, in a normal boot0, will end up continuing execution at $B700 which is stored in track 0, sector 1. But in this case, I see:</p>

    </div>
    <p class="seen">OK, that's harmless (as far as copy protection goes). This boot0 code is close enough to normal that I should be able to run my AUTOTRACE1 script to patch the boot0 code and interrupt the boot before it jumps to boot1.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original disk</p>
    <p class="seen">was written, this copy may or may not be able to read itself. I may need to patch the disk's RWTS to deal with the fact that the disk is now in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p class="seen">run. The copies I tried to make -- even the bit copies -- just rebooted endlessly, which means there is some code being executed during boot to check if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p>Just by booting my copy, I can rule out problem #1. The disk seems to read itself just fine. It makes it exactly as far as my failed bit copy -- far enough to figure out that it's not an original disk, fill the screen with garbage, and reboot.</p>

      <p class="comment">This area is normally not important, so COPYA didn't copy it precisely because normal disks don't care. (Actually, it's even more evil than that, because the original disk is written with timing bits in specific non-standard places between the nibbles in the dead zone. This code not only requires the right nibbles in the right order, it reads them just slightly slower than normal. So the timing bits need to be in the right places too, or else this code will read the wrong nibble values while it's out of sync. This will trip up even the best bit copiers.</p>

    <p class="seen">That last section at $0286..$0290 is interesting. After the nibble check passes, it replaces two bytes at $9E4E and $9E4F, then immediately jumps to $9E4D. That implies that this nibble check is called via an unconditional jump, not a JSR. With my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I searched the disk for "4C 0C 02" and found one reference on track 00, sector 0B, byte $4D. I wonder if I can just change those two bytes to bypass the nibble check altogether and turn this into a working copy:</p>
