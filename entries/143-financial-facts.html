    <p class="seen">Somebody been sellin' copy protection.</p>
    <p class="seen">This write-up is based on my previous write-ups of those disks, with a few updates because my AUTOTRACE program has gotten smarter over time.]</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately.</p>
    <p class="seen">Locksmith Fast Disk Backup fares no better. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy it creates just hangs on boot with the drive motor on.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I go to "Input/Output Control" (press "O") and set CHECKSUM ENABLED = NO. This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences -- as long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track, with one exception: T00,S0A.</p>
    <p class="seen">Given that the original disk boots correctly, I'm going to guess that this sector is either unused (in which case,</p>
    <p class="seen">I have a damaged original disk but caught a lucky break) or part of a copy protection scheme (in which case I don't care).</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. So no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Let's see if AUTOTRACE can capture the RWTS from the original disk. If not, I'll have to resort to manual investigation.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">There was one warning along the way, though: boot0 is not jumping to boot1 in the usual way. Let's see what that's about.</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>]BLOAD BOOT0,A$800
]CALL -151</code>
      <code>*801L
...</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Everything here looks pretty normal (i.e. just like an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk), until it goes to jump to the boot1 code. Usually that happens with an indirect JMP ($08FD), which, in a normal boot0, will end up continuing execution at $B700 which is stored in track 0, sector 1. But in this case, I see:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>084A-   6C FE BB    JMP   ($BBFE)</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Highly suspect. I definitely want to see what evil lurks at whatever address $BBFE is pointing to. That area of memory is normally reserved for the denibblizing process when reading data from a sector. It's scratch space, essentially. It's overwritten every time the RWTS reads a sector from the disk (after boot1 is loaded).</p>

    <p class="seen">The important takeaway here is that there don't appear to be any long-term side effects of this copy protection.</p>
    <p class="seen">If it succeeds, it restores everything that it modified (in the RWTS code), then it just jumps to $B700 to start the boot1 phase. But that's it; nothing else seems to rely on some magic number that it pulls from the raw nibbles or anything. It doesn't decrypt anything.</p>
    <p class="seen">It doesn't even clear the carry flag.</p>
    <p class="seen">With that knowledge, I can safely ignore it and focus on getting the disk into a standard format, using Advanced</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave a read error on T00,S0A, but that's OK. I already know that that's part of the copy protection, so I don't care about it.</p>
    <p class="seen">The rest of the disk reads just fine.</p>
    <p class="seen">This is the power and the genius of</p>
    <p class="seen">Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original disk</p>
    <p class="seen">was written, my copy may or may not be able to read itself. I may need to patch the disk's RWTS to deal with the fact that the disk is now in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p class="seen">run, because it's executing a copy protection routine during boot to check if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p class="seen">I already have enough information to fix problem #2. The copy protection is located at $BB00, and it is executed immediately after boot0 (T00,S00) loads boot1 (T00,S01-09). This line of code:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>084A-   6C FE BB    JMP   ($BBFE)</code>

    <p class="seen">Now the disk boots far enough to start grinding, because it can't read itself.</p>
    <p class="seen">The RWTS still expects the rest of the disk to be in a non-standard format, but that's no longer true -- Advanced</p>
    <p class="seen">Demuffin wrote out each sector in a standard format. So I need to patch the RWTS on my copy so it can read itself.</p>
    <p class="seen">The original disk uses a modified version of DOS 3.3. (It's so close, that I was able to capture it with my automated tools.) So I'm really just reverting the modifications they made 30 years ago. Better late than never.</p>
    <p class="seen">For future reference (mostly mine), here's a nice chart of the memory locations for all the prologues and epilogues in a DOS 3.3-shaped RWTS. If the RWTS stores $B700 in T00,S01 (most do), then $B8xx will be in T00,S02; $B9xx in T00,S03; and so on.</p>
