    <p>Math Man is a 1984 educational action game (seriously). It was developed by</p>
    <p>Applied Systems Knowledge, Ltd. and distributed by Scholastic.</p>
    <p>The original disk appears to copy with COPYA, but the copy does not work. It loads DOS, displays the usual "]" prompt, then reboots. If I try to</p>
    <p>Ctrl-C break into BASIC, it reboots. If</p>
    <p>I try to Ctrl-Reset break, I can get to a prompt, but any command (CATALOG, LIST, &c.) reboots.</p>
    <p>Firing up my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, I searched for "4C 00 C6" and found a suspicious instance on T00,S0C. This sector is normally part of DOS, and a quick glance at the surrounding code seems to confirm that it is part of DOS. But DOS does not usually include any explicit reboots.</p>
    <p>Let's remove it and see what happens.</p>
    <p>T00,S0C,$49 change "4C" to "2C"</p>
    <p>OK, a small amount of progress. The game still reboots after the "]" prompt, but Ctrl-C breaks instead of rebooting, and commands like LIST and CATALOG work.</p>

    <p>Pronto-DOS on a commercial disk. Nice.</p>
    <p>And the original disk appears to include source code for most of the code files, which is very unusual. (There was no Free Software movement in the 1980s. The GNU GPL didn't exist until 1989, and didn't take off until version 2 of the license was released in 1991.)</p>
    <p>(Edit from the future: yup, all the .S files are Merlin source code files. No copyright license mentioned.)</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>]LIST</code>

    <div class="terminal_output">

    </div>
    <p>Initial plan of action: copy all of these files to a freshly formatted</p>
    <p>Pronto-DOS disk (who knows what other surprises lurk in this customized DOS), seek and destroy the nibble check (my intuition tells me it's in MAN1), declare victory and go home.</p>
    <p>Stumbling block #1: Copy ][+ tells me that the disk is empty. Well, not empty exactly, but no files.</p>
    <div class="terminal_output">
      <code>
CATALOG DISK            SLOT 6  DRIVE 1
DISK VOLUME 254</code>
      <code>NO FILES</code>
      <code>
SECTORS FREE:81   USED:479   TOTAL:560</code>
      <code>PRESS [RETURN]</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen"></p>
    <p>Curiouser and curiouser: the free sector count matches the output I got when I booted the disk and ran the CATALOG from there. So Copy ][+ is reading part of the catalog (the part that tracks which sectors are used), but it's missing the rest of the catalog (the part that tracks which files are on the disk).</p>
    <p>Never a dull moment in the land of</p>
    <p>Apple II copy protection.</p>
    <p>Poking around with a sector editor, it appears that the VTOC starts on T11,S00 as usual, and this points to T11,S0F as usual. But T11,S0F is empty, so if you haven't booted from the disk, the disk catalog appears to have no files.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I found the rest of the VTOC on track 3. Based on the order of the files in the CATALOG, it appears to start on T03,S0F and work backwards through track 3. But how does the original disk know that? I scoured "Beneath Apple DOS" until I found the answer on page 8-28:</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[begin quote]</code>
    </div>
    <p>B011-B036 Read a directory sector ; (If CARRY flag is zero on entry, read</p>
    <p>first directory sector. If CARRY is one, read next)</p>
    <p>; Memorize entry code. ; Set buffer pointers (B045). ; First or next? ; If first, get track/sector of</p>
    <p>directory sector from VTOC at offset +1,+2.</p>
    <p>; Otherwise, get track/sector from</p>
    <p>directory sector at offset +1,+2. If track is zero, exit with error code (end of directory).</p>
    <p>; Call RWTS to read sector. ; Exit with normal return code.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[end quote]</code>
    </div>
    <p>So, to read the first sector of file names and other metadata, this routine is supposed to look at the VTOC sector buffer (read from T11,S00 and stored at $B3BB..$B4BA). The VTOC says "hey, the first sector of files and stuff is in T11,S0F" so this routine is supposed to read T11,S0F.</p>
    <p>But the DOS on this disk made one small modification to that routine:</p>

    <p>Instead of getting the track number from the VTOC, it hard-codes track 3.</p>
    <p>Now that I've identified the problem, the fix is straightforward. If I change the VTOC header (T11,S00) to point to the actual first directory sector (T03,S0F), DOS 3.3 or any other copy utility should be able to read the entire catalog. DOS 3.3 is certainly flexible enough to handle this. Storing the entire VTOC on track $11 is just a convention; DOS doesn't actually care where directory sectors are stored as long as it can find the next one.</p>
    <p>T11,S00,$01 change "11" to "03"</p>
    <p>As I suspected, Copy ][+ now correctly displays the disk catalog, and I can copy all the files to a freshly formatted Pronto-DOS disk.</p>
    <div class="curses_input">
      <code>[S6D1=freshly formatted disk]
[S6D2=non-working copy]</code>
    </div>
    <p>Copy ][+</p>
    <p>--> COPY --> FILES --> S6,D2 to S6,D1</p>
    <p>Now I have two non-working copies: one (in drive 2) with the modified version of Pronto-DOS (but a neutralized reboot instruction on T00,S0C and a fixed up VTOC on T11,S00), and another (in drive 1) with a standard Pronto-DOS and all the files copied over. I'm done with the copy in drive 2.</p>
    <p>But there is still the matter of the copy protection that fails and reboots.</p>
    <p>Let's go back and take a second look at that HELLO program.</p>

    <p>OK, it appears that this nibble check has no side effects. I should be able to bypass it entirely by just not calling it. Since it was BRUN from the HELLO program, that means just deleting the line of BASIC that BRUN'd it. (I have no idea how to turn "BRUN" into a past tense verb.)</p>
