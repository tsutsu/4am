    <p>"Microzine" was an educational disk- based magazine published by Scholastic between 1983 and 1992. Issue no. 13 is a double-sided disk that features "The</p>
    <p>Frog and the Fables" and "The Secret of the Sphinx."</p>

    <p class="seen">Somebody been sellin' copy protection.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this write-up is quite similar to those, except that my AUTOTRACE program has gotten smarter over time, so more of the process is automated.]</p>
    <p>Booting the disk looks and sounds like a normal DOS 3.3 boot, complete with the drive seeking to track 2, then 1, then 0, then swinging to the middle of the disk to read the catalog track. It even displays a BASIC prompt during boot, as if it's loading a boot program (like "HELLO").</p>
    <p class="seen">However, the disk is uncopyable by any automated method. COPYA fails miserably and immediately. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy it creates only gets as far as loading DOS and displaying the BASIC prompt before filling the screen with garbage and rebooting.</p>
    <p class="seen">In my experience, disks do not spontaneously reboot unless someone tells them to.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I press "O" to get to the</p>
    <p class="seen">Input/Output Control and set "CHECKSUM ENABLED" to "NO". This will ignore the checksum bytes and epilogue sequences. i.e. As long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p>Track $11 does appear to contain a disk catalog, which strongly suggests this disk is file-based.</p>
    <p class="seen">Based on my limited experience cracking other disks, I would guess that this disk has</p>
    <p class="seen">- Standard prologue bytes before the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">Copy ][+ sector editor would give read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED" option]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the</p>
    <p class="seen">address and data fields [otherwise COPYA would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">- Some secondary protection [otherwise</p>
    <p class="seen">the bit copy created with EDD 4 would work]</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. So, no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format.</p>
    <p>Just by looking at the first few sectors, it appears that this disk uses a DOS 3.3-derived RWTS, which means that my AUTOTRACE program should be able to extract the RWTS from the original disk.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p>For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file acalled "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I can use Advanced Demuffin to convert the disk to a standard format. (It uses the disk's own RWTS to read the original, then a standard DOS 3.3- compatible RWTS to write out the data, sector by sector.)</p>
    <p>Along the way, AUTOTRACE gave me two different warnings, which is very exciting(*). I just added the warnings recently, and here I am already reaping the benefits.</p>
    <p class="seen">(*)not guaranteed, excitement may vary</p>
    <p>Let's see what the first one is about.</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>/!\ BOOT0 JUMPS TO $08C0</code>
      <code>]BLOAD BOOT0,A$800
]CALL -151</code>
      <code>*801L
...</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">Everything here looks pretty normal (i.e. just like an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk), until it goes to jump to the boot1 code. Usually that happens with an indirect JMP ($08FD), which, in a normal boot0, will end up continuing execution at $B700 which is stored in track 0, sector 1. But in this case, I see:</p>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>084A-   4C C0 08    JMP   $08C0</code>
    </div>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>*8C0L</code>
    </div>
    <div class="listing">
      <code>08C0-   8E E9 B7    STX   $B7E9
08C3-   6C FD 08    JMP   ($08FD)</code>
    </div>
    <p>I've seen this pattern before on other disks -- "Gertrude's Secrets" and "Xevious", just to name two. It usually means that some code at $B700 will be calling a subroutine that I don't particularly want it to call (like a nibble check).</p>
    <p>The second warning provides additional evidence of this:</p>
    <div class="line_editing">
      <code>/!\ NIBBLE CHECK AT $BB00</code>
    </div>
    <p>I'll deal with that later. Right now I want to focus on converting this disk to a standard format. I have the RWTS and can load it into Advanced Demuffin.</p>

    <p>The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. (I repeated the procedure on side B, also with no errors.) This is the power and the genius of Advanced</p>
    <p>Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original disk</p>
    <p class="seen">was written, this copy may or may not be able to read itself. I may need to patch the disk's RWTS to deal with the fact that the disk is now in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p class="seen">run. The copies I tried to make -- even the bit copies -- just rebooted endlessly, which means there is some code being executed during boot to check if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p class="seen">Just by booting my copy, I can rule out problem #1. The disk seems to read itself just fine. It makes it exactly as far as my failed bit copy -- far enough to figure out that it's not an original disk, fill the screen with garbage, and reboot.</p>

    <p>The disk boots and runs without complaint. This tells me that there isn't any coordination with or reliance on the custom DOS once the program loads. (Some programs manually check for specific non-standard values in the DOS area in memory. But I don't see any evidence of that here.)</p>

This code not only requires the right nibbles in the right order, it reads them just slightly slower than normal. So the timing bits need to be in the right places too, or else this code will read the wrong nibble values while it's out of sync. This will trip up even the best bit copiers.</p>

    <p>That last section at $0286..$0290 is interesting. After the nibble check passes, it replaces two bytes at $9E4E and $9E4F, then immediately jumps to $9E4D. That implies that this nibble check is called from $9E4D via an unconditional jump (not a JSR). With my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I searched the disk for "4C 0C 02" and lo and behold! Track $00, sector $0B, byte $4D contains a "JMP $020C".</p>
    <p>If I'm reading this correctly, I should be able to change that JMP back to its original target ($A180) and bypass the nibble check altogether.</p>
    <p class="seen">T00,S0B,$4E change "0C 02" to "80 A1"</p>
    <p class="seen">Success! The disk boots and runs with no complaint. There doesn't appear to be any further protection.</p>
