    <p>"Computer Laboratory for Calculus" is a 1985 educational program by Chris</p>
    <p>W. Avery and Frank Soler and distributed by The Math Lab.</p>
    <p class="seen">COPYA fails miserably and immediately.</p>
    <p>Locksmith Fast Disk Backup fares no better. EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors, but the copy it creates crashes after loading DOS.</p>
    <p class="seen">Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sector editor, I go to "Input/Output Control" (press "O") and set CHECKSUM ENABLED = NO. This option ignores checksum bytes and epilogue sequences -- as long as the address and data prologue are standard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD", respectively), this will allow me to read each sector. And lo and behold, it works! I can read the data from every sector on every track.</p>
    <p class="seen">Given the (relatively) weak structural protection, I used to turn to the DOS</p>
    <p class="seen">3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS to ignore checksums and epilogue bytes (changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"), and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, and completely by accident, I came across an original disk with a bad sector. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me.</p>
    <p class="seen">These floppies are decades old by now; it's amazing any of them work at all.</p>
    <p class="seen">The point is, I shouldn't be using tools that ignore potentially serious read errors. So no more COPYA+B942:18 patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffin or Advanced Demuffin to convert disks to a standard format. Let's see if AUTOTRACE can capture the RWTS from the original disk. If not, I'll have to resort to manual investigation.</p>

    <p class="seen">For those of you just tuning in, my work disk uses a custom program that I affectionately call "AUTOTRACE" to automate the process of boot tracing as far as possible. For some disks, this just captures track 0, sector 0 (saved in a file called "BOOT0") and stops.</p>
    <p class="seen">For other disks that load in the same way that an unprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, it captures the next stage of the boot process as well (in a file called "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 on track 0, which are loaded into memory at $B600..$BFFF. This generally contains the RWTS routines which the program uses to read the rest of the disk.</p>
    <p class="seen">If the RWTS is fairly normal as well (and my AUTOTRACE program just spot- checks a few memory locations to guess at its "normalcy"), there's a good chance I'll be able to use a tool called Advanced Demuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack) to convert the disk from whatever weird format it uses to store its sector data into a standard disk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3 disks or any other third-party tools.</p>
    <p class="seen">In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts the RWTS routines (generally loaded from track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a third file called "RWTS".</p>
    <p class="seen">If anything looks fishy or non- standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and I have to check the files it saved so far to determine why. But in this case, it ran all the way through, automatically capturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now I use plug that RWTS file into</p>
    <p class="seen">Advanced Demuffin and try to convert the data on this disk to a standard format.</p>

    <p class="seen">The disk's own RWTS gave no read errors on any track. This is the power and the genius of Advanced Demuffin. Every disk must be able to read itself. So, let it read itself, then capture the data and write it out in a standard format.</p>

    <p class="seen">There are two problems with this copy:</p>
    <p class="seen">1. Depending on how the original disk</p>
    <p class="seen">was written, my copy may or may not be able to read itself. I may need to patch the disk's RWTS to deal with the fact that the disk is now in a standard format.</p>
    <p class="seen">2. Even if it can read itself, it won't</p>
    <p class="seen">run, because it's executing a copy protection routine during boot to check if the disk is original. (Hint: it's not.)</p>
    <p>Booting the demuffin'd copy confirms that #1 is not a problem. The disk boots and reads itself perfectly, right up until it crashes at $910A.</p>
</section>

<section>

    <p>Slight tangent: have you ever wondered why some RWTS code *doesn't* need to be changed? This original disk couldn't be read by a standard RWTS (because COPYA tried and failed). But once I convert the disk to a standard format, why can the modified RWTS still read a disk in a standard format?</p>
    <p>This is a common technique for programs that use two disks (a program disk and a data disk), or programs that let you create your own data disks. Typically, the program disk is read-only, but the data disk needs to be writable.</p>
    <p>Depending on the type of data, users may also expect the data disk to be unprotected, especially if they're creating files that are usable by themselves or by other programs.</p>
    <p>Thus, "liberal" RWTS code was invented.</p>

    <p>Odd. The usual memory locations ($B935, $B93F) for the data epilogue bytes are unchanged. But the code never gets that far, because at $B92F it jumps to $BCDF to do... something.</p>

    <p>This code will actually accept two different bytes for the first epilogue, $AB or $DE. And it will also accept two for the second byte, $FF or $AA.</p>
    <p>Technically this gives you a total of four possible epilogue sequences that this RWTS would read as valid, although</p>
    <p>I believe this program only uses two of them ("AB FF" for the original program disk, and "DE AA", which is standard, for user-created data disks). Since my demuffin'd copy uses "DE AA", the RWTS can read it without complaint.</p>
    <p>There are more sophisticated methods that accept a broader or narrower range of bytes without taking up additional space in the RWTS, but that's how this particular disk accomplishes it.</p>
</section>

<section>

    <p>Anyway, so the demuffin'd copy can read itself (yay), but it still crashes on boot (boo). In fact, it crashes in exactly the same way as my failed bit copy did, which tells me that the crash is intentional and part of a copy protection routine.</p>
    <p>Copy ][+ says the boot program is "XMGPRT", a binary file that loads at $9000. So let's start there.</p>

    <p class="seen">Aha! It's not an infinite loop after all. Well, it is, technically, but it won't actually run forever. It's not easy to show in plain text, but the initial "D" and the final "M@" are in inverse. So that string starts with</p>
    <p class="seen">Ctrl-D and ends with Ctrl-M and a null byte. Since DOS is already loaded, printing this through the DOS vector will execute that command, as if you typed it from a prompt yourself. Since that program never returns to the caller, it will break out of the seemingly "infinite" loop.</p>
    <p>Since there are no side effects to the copy protection routine, I can change this file to simply skip over it and go straight to running HELLO.</p>
