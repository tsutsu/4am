------------Water in the Air-----------A 4am crack                  2014-06-14---------------------------------------"Water in the Air" is a 1985educational program programmed by FrankR. Salamon and distributed by E.M.E.(Educational Materials and EquipmentCorporation).[Note: option #2 on the main menu asksfor a quiz disk, which I do not have.If you have it or find it, please usethis write-up as a guide to preserve itas well.]The original disk is uncopyable byCOPYA or Locksmith Fast Disk Backup.EDD 4 bit copy gives no read errors,but the copy just grinds a few timesand reboots.Some manual inspection with the Copy][+ nibble editor reveals that everyodd track has a non-standard addressprologue:Track | Address  | Data------+----------+---------- $00  | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $01  | D4 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $02  | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $03  | D4 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $04  | D5 AA 96 | D5 AA AD $05  | D4 AA 96 | D5 AA AD&.The address epilogue also varies fromtrack to track. The data prologue andepilogue appear to be standard.This is too complicated for a tool likeSuper Demuffin, which assumes the samestructure on each track. But based onthe information I've gathered so far,it shouldn't be difficult to capturethe RWTS and load it into AdvancedDemuffin.[S6,D1=original disk][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5...CAPTURING BOOT0...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0For those of you just tuning in, mywork disk uses a custom program that Iaffectionately call "AUTOTRACE" toautomate the process of boot tracing asmuch as possible. For some disks (likethis one, apparently), it just capturestrack 0, sector 0 (saved in a filecalled "BOOT0") and stops. For otherdisks that load in the same way that anunprotected DOS 3.3 disk loads, itcaptures the next stage of the bootprocess as well (in a file called"BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors 0-9 ontrack 0, which are loaded into memoryat $B600..$BFFF. This generallycontains the RWTS routines which theprogram uses to read the rest of thedisk.If the RWTS is fairly normal as well(and my AUTOTRACE program just spot-checks a few memory locations to guessat its "normalcy"), AUTOTRACE extractsthe RWTS routines (generally loadedfrom track 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF) and saves *that* into a thirdfile called "RWTS". There's a goodchance I'll be able to load that "RWTS"file into a tool called AdvancedDemuffin (written in 1983 by The Stack)to convert the disk into a standarddisk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3disks or any other third-party tools.If anything looks fishy or non-standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and Ihave to check the files it saved so farto determine why. In this case, itstopped after capturing T00,S00. So Ineed to look at that sector and figureout why.]CALL -151*800<2800.28FFM*801L...I've seen a lot of boot0 code fromdifferent copy-protected (and notcopy-protected) disks, so I've kind ofdeveloped a sense of what a "normal"boot looks like. I can look at almost-but-not-quite normal boot0 code andhone in pretty quickly on the partthat's unusual. Maybe it calls asubroutine that isn't normally called,or it does things in a strange order,or it jumps to an unusual place afterloading the boot1 code.Everything here looks pretty normal(i.e. just like an unprotected DOS 3.3disk), until it goes to jump to theboot1 code. Usually that happens withan indirect JMP ($08FD), which, in anormal boot0, will end up continuingexecution at $B700 which is stored intrack 0, sector 1. But in this case, Isee:084A-   4C 00 BB    JMP   $BB00Highly suspect. I definitely want tosee what evil lurks at $BB00. That areaof memory is normally reserved for thedenibblizing process when reading datafrom a sector. It's scratch space,essentially. It's overwritten everytime the disk reads itself (after boot1is loaded).But $BB00 isn't loaded yet, because Iinterrupted the boot process before itcould be loaded. So now I need to tracethe boot again, but a little bitfurther -- far enough for boot0 to loadboot1 (including the suspicious code at$BB00), but no further.My work disk has another program,unimaginatively named AUTOTRACE1, whichdoes just that. It loads track 0,sector 0, then patches the boot0 codeat $084A to call back to a routineunder my control (instead of jumping tothe original disk's boot1 code). Theonly reason it didn't run already isthat the instruction at $084A is non-standard. But the boot0 code is closeenough to standard that AUTOTRACE1should be able to patch it. (I mean,we *are* patching assembly languagecode here. There's a very low tolerancefor error.)]BRUN AUTOTRACE1...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT1SAVING RWTSWell, that worked flawlessly. Not onlydid I get the rest of the boot1 code,but the RWTS is apparently in asstandard location too. So before Iinvestigate the nibble check at $BB00,I'm going to load that RWTS intoAdvanced Demuffin to convert the diskto a standard format.Advanced Demuffin will only load RWTSfiles from a drive in slot 6, which isannoying since mine is in slot 5. Noteto self: patch that someday. In themeantime, I'm swapping floppy diskslike some kind of 20th century peasant.[S6,D1=my work disk]]PR#6]BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1--> LOAD NEW RWTS MODULE    At $B8, load "RWTS"    from drive 1[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]--> FORMAT TARGET DISK...grind grind grind...--> CONVERT DISKThis disk is 16 sectors, and thedefault options (copy the entire disk,all tracks, all sectors) don't need tobe changed unless something goeshorribly wrong.ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1  - COPYRIGHT 1983WRITTEN BY THE STACK -CORRUPT COMPUTING=======PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE=======TRK:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR+R5:    0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012SC0:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC1:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC2:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC3:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC4:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC5:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC6:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC7:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC8:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSC9:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCA:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCB:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCC:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCD:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCE:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSCF:RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR=======================================16 SC $00,$00 TO $22,$0F BY $01 TO DRV2Those "R" flags?

Because f--- you, that's why.Because it makes the extracted RWTSuseless without initializing the magiczero page location with the right magicnumber. Automated RWTS extractionprograms wouldn't find this (as I justsaw when Advanced Demuffin failed toread the original disk with the RWTSfrom the original disk). Everything isa countermeasure to something.This calls for an IOB module. What's an IOB module? Well, the authorof Advanced Demuffin anticipated thathe couldn't anticipate everything, sohe made the program extensible. Quotingfrom the Advanced Demuffin softdocs(included on my work disk):                 --v--An IOB module is an interface for thesource RWTS. Advanced Demuffin uses theIOB module to set up the IOB table andjump to RWTS.  The IOB module is storedfrom $1400-$14FB. When AdvancedDemuffin loads in a IOB module, itreads the first sector of the file offthe track-sector list and stores it at$13FC-$14FB. When Advanced Demuffinwants to read a sector it JSRs to theIOB module with the phase number,sector number, and the page numberstored in the A, Y and X registersrespectively. Since the source drivealways has to be drive one, AdvancedDemuffin can make the IOB module verycompact. After it gets the page,trackand sector Advanced Demuffin sets upthe IOB for RWTS using this infor-mation, and JMPs to RWTS. (It jumpsinstead of JSRing, because it lets theRWTS do the RTS.) Here is a list of theIOB module that is built in to AdvancedDemuffin:; Convert phase # to track #1400-   4A          LSR; Store track number1401-   8D 22 0F    STA   $0F22; Store sector number1404-   8C 23 0F    STY   $0F23; Store page number; [note: original docs have incorrect;        hex opcode on this line]1407-   8E 27 0F    STX   $0F27140A-   A9 01       LDA   #$01; Store the drive number140C-   8D 20 0F    STA   $0F20; Store the read code140F-   8D 2A 0F    STA   $0F2A; With high byte of IOB1412-   A9 0F       LDA   #$0F; With low byte of IOB1414-   A0 1E       LDY   #$1E; Goto RWTS1416-   4C 00 BD    JMP   $BD00                 --^--Basically, Advanced Demuffin only knowshow to call a custom RWTS if it1. is loaded at $B800..$BFFF2. uses a standard RWTS parameter table3. has an entry point at $BD00 that   takes the address of the parameter   tables in A and Y4. doesn't require initializationAs it turns out, that covers a *lot* ofcopy protected disks, but it doesn'tcover this one because the RWTS relieson the value of zero page $31.So, let's make an IOB module.]CALL -151; Most of this is identical to the; standard IOB module that comes with; Advanced Demuffin (explained above).1400-   4A          LSR1401-   8D 22 0F    STA   $0F221404-   8C 23 0F    STY   $0F231407-   8E 27 0F    STX   $0F27140A-   A9 01       LDA   #$01140C-   8D 20 0F    STA   $0F20140F-   8D 2A 0F    STA   $0F2A; initialize the magic zero page value1412-   A9 AA       LDA   #$AA1414-   85 31       STA   $31; get the address of the RWTS parameter; table at $0F1E and call the RWTS1416-   A9 0F       LDA   #$0F1418-   A0 1E       LDY   #$1E141A-   4C 00 BD    JMP   $BD00*BSAVE IOB,A$1400,L$1DNow let's tell Advanced Demuffin to usethis custom IOB as well as the RWTS wecaptured from the original disk.[S6,D1=my work disk]]BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.1--> LOAD NEW RWTS MODULE    At $38, load "RWTS"    from D1--> LOAD NEW IOB MODULE    load "IOB"    from D1[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk]--> CONVERT DISK--> CHANGE DEFAULT VALUES?
