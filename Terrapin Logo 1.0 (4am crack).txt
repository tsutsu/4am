What does that tell us?  no half or quarter tracks  almost certainly no nibble check  (just structural changes to epilogue)Next steps:  1. capture RWTS with AUTOTRACE  2. convert disk to standard format     with Advanced Demuffin  3. patch RWTS to read standard format                   ~               Chapter 1In Which We Attempt To Use The Original    Disk As A Weapon Against Itself[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5CAPTURING BOOT0...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0CAPTURING BOOT1...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT1SAVING RWTS]BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.5["5" to switch to slot 5]["R" to load a new RWTS module]  --> At $B8, load "RWTS" from drive 1["6" to switch to slot 6]["C" to convert disk]                 --v--ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.5    (C) 1983, 2014ORIGINAL BY THE STACK    UPDATES BY 4AM=======PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE=======TRK:...................................+.5:    0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012SC0:...................................SC1:...................................SC2:...................................SC3:...................................SC4:...................................SC5:...................................SC6:...................................SC7:...................................SC8:...................................SC9:...................................SCA:...................................SCB:...................................SCC:...................................SCD:...................................SCE:...................................SCF:...................................=======================================16SC $00,$00-$22,$0F BY1.0 S6,D1->S6,D2                 --^--]PR#5...]CATALOG,S6,D2 B 002 STARTLOGO B 128 LOGO]BRUN STARTLOGO...crashes...[S5,D1=DOS 3.3 master disk]]PR#5]BRUN STARTLOGO,S6,D2...program loads and runs...So it doesn't like Diversi-DOS 64K (theDOS on my work disk). It's probablyaccessing DOS functions directly orassuming the RWTS parameter table is atspecific address, instead of using thevectors on page 3. But it works when Iboot an unmodified DOS 3.3 first, so itisn't checking for its original DOS atruntime.[S6,D1=demuffin'd copy]]PR#6...grinds then crashes...The demuffin'd disk can't read itself.This is not unusual.                   ~               Chapter 2 In Which We Remove All Traces Of CopyProtection Using An Automated Tool That   I Wrote For Just Such An Occasion[S6,D1=demuffin'd copy][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5]BRUN PDPT00,S03,$91 change DA to DET00,S03,$35 change DA to DET00,S02,$9E change DA to DEDisk 2 is unprotected.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 488------------------EOF------------------
