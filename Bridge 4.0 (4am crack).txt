---------------Bridge 4.0--------------A 4am crack                  2014-10-28---------------------------------------"Bridge 4.0" is a 1983 card gamewritten by Arthur Walsh and distributedby Artworx.COPYA fails miserably and immediately.EDD 4 bit copy works, and the copyboots and runs without complaint. Thistells me that there is some structuralprotection (i.e. data is stored on thedisk in a non-standard way) butprobably no secondary protection(e.g. an assembly language routine thatexecutes during the boot process todetermine whether it's booting from theoriginal disk).The original disk appears to boot amodified DOS 3.3. Listening to the diskdrive, it quickly moves out to track 2,then back to track 1, then track 0,then swings out to track $11 to readthe disk catalog and load the startupprogram (HELLO or similar). You canhear a lot just by listening.Turning to my trusty Disk Fixer sectoreditor, I go to "Input/Output Control"(press "O") and set CHECKSUM ENABLED =NO. This option ignores checksum bytesand epilogue sequences -- as long asthe address and data prologue arestandard ("D5 AA 96" and "D5 AA AD",respectively), this will allow me toread each sector. And lo and behold, itworks! I can read the data from everysector on every track.Given the (relatively) weak structuralprotection, I used to turn to the DOS3.3 master disk, patch the RWTS toignore checksums and epilogue bytes(changing $B942 from "SEC" to "CLC"),and run COPYA. Then, one fine day, andcompletely by accident, I came acrossan original disk with a bad sector. Isuppose this shouldn't surprise me.These floppies are decades old by now;it's amazing any of them work at all.The point is, I shouldn't be usingtools that ignore potentially seriousread errors. So no more COPYA+B942:18patch. From now on, it's Super Demuffinor Advanced Demuffin to convert disksto a standard format. Let's see ifAUTOTRACE can capture the RWTS from theoriginal disk. If not, I'll have toresort to manual investigation.[S6,D1=original disk][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5...CAPTURING BOOT0...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT0CAPTURING BOOT1...reboots slot 6......reboots slot 5...SAVING BOOT1SAVING RWTSFor those of you just tuning in, mywork disk uses a custom program that Iaffectionately call "AUTOTRACE" toautomate the process of boot tracing asfar as possible. For some disks, thisjust captures track 0, sector 0 (savedin a file called "BOOT0") and stops.For other disks that load in the sameway that an unprotected DOS 3.3 diskloads, it captures the next stage ofthe boot process as well (in a filecalled "BOOT1"). BOOT1 contains sectors0-9 on track 0, which are loaded intomemory at $B600..$BFFF. This generallycontains the RWTS routines which theprogram uses to read the rest of thedisk.If the RWTS is fairly normal as well(and my AUTOTRACE program just spot-checks a few memory locations to guessat its "normalcy"), there's a goodchance I'll be able to use a toolcalled Advanced Demuffin (written in1983 by The Stack) to convert the diskfrom whatever weird format it uses tostore its sector data into a standarddisk readable by unprotected DOS 3.3disks or any other third-party tools.In this case, AUTOTRACE extracts theRWTS routines (generally loaded fromtrack 0, sectors 2-9 into $B800..$BFFF)and saves *that* into a third filecalled "RWTS".If anything looks fishy or non-standard, AUTOTRACE just stops, and Ihave to check the files it saved so farto determine why. But in this case, itran all the way through, automaticallycapturing BOOT0, BOOT1, and RWTS files.Now I use plug that RWTS file intoAdvanced Demuffin and try to convertthe data on this disk to a standardformat.[S6,D1=original disk][S6,D2=blank disk][S5,D1=my work disk]]PR#5...]BRUN ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.5[press "5" to switch to slot 5][press "R" to load a new RWTS module]  --> At $B8, load "RWTS" from drive 1[press "6" to switch to slot 6][press "C" to convert disk]This disk is 16 sectors, and thedefault options (copy the entire disk,all tracks, all sectors) don't need tobe changed unless something goeshorribly wrong.                 --v--ADVANCED DEMUFFIN 1.5    (C) 1983, 2014ORIGINAL BY THE STACK    UPDATES BY 4AM=======PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE=======TRK:...................................+.5:    0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF012SC0:...................................SC1:...................................SC2:...................................SC3:...................................SC4:...................................SC5:...................................SC6:...................................SC7:...................................SC8:...................................SC9:...................................SCA:...................................SCB:...................................SCC:...................................SCD:...................................SCE:...................................SCF:...................................=======================================16SC $00,$00-$22,$0F BY1.0 S6,D1->S6,D2                 --^--The disk's own RWTS gave no read errorson any track. This is the power and thegenius of Advanced Demuffin. Every diskmust be able to read itself. So, let itread itself, then capture the data andwrite it out in a standard format.]PR#5...]CATALOG,S6,D2C1983 DSR^C#254426 FREE A 002 ARTWORX A 068 BRIDGE4]RUN ARTWORXSuccess! The program loads and runswithout complaint. All further diskaccess is done through standard DOSfunctions. (It even runs from drive 2!)While that's excellent progress, I'mnot quite done yet. Booting thedemuffin'd disk directly just grindsendlessly, because it still has theoriginal RWTS on it. That is, it stillassumes that the data on the disk isstored in a non-standard format. Butthat's not true anymore, becauseAdvanced Demuffin just normalized thedisk format. So I need to patch theRWTS on my copy so it can read itself.A lot of disks need this sort of post-demuffin patching, and I got tired ofdoing it manually, so I wrote a programto do it for me. It is called,unsurprisingly, Post-Demuffin Patcher.It prompts you to select a slot anddrive, then reads the demuffin'd disk,checks for a modified DOS 3.3-shapedRWTS, and applies the necessary patchesso the disk can read itself. (It canalso detect and bypass some nibblechecks.) I've included a copy of Post-Demuffin Patcher on my work disk; thefull source code is currently availableat <https://archive.org/details/PostDemuffinPatcher4am>.[S6,D1=demuffin'd copy]]PR#5...]BRUN PDPT00,S03,$91 change DF to DET00,S06,$AE change DF to DE(This is the actual output of theprogram.

There doesn't appear tobe any further protection. Hooray forautomation.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 153------------------EOF------------------
