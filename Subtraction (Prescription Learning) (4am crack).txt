--------------Subtraction--------------A 4am crack                  2015-06-25---------------------------------------Name: SubtractionVersion: "revised 1984"Genre: educationalYear: 1980, 1984Publisher: Prescription LearningMedia: 8 single-sided 5.25-inch disksOS: PascalOther versions: none (preserved here  for the first time)Identical cracks:  Multiplication (crack no. 340)  Addition (crack no. 348)All 8 disks are bootable and appear tobe independent of each other. I'llstart with disk 1.                   ~               Chapter 0 In Which Various Automated Tools Fail          In Interesting WaysCOPYA  immediate disk read errorLocksmith Fast Disk Backup  reads everything except T00,S00EDD 4 bit copy (no sync, no count)  worksCopy ][+ nibble editor  T00,S00 uses data epilogue "ED AA EB"  everything else is normalDisk Fixer  ["O" -> "Input/Output Control"]    set Data Epilogue to "ED AA EB"  Success! T00,S00 readable!  looks like a standard Pascal boot0Why didn't COPYA work?  modified data epilogue on T00,S00Why didn't Locksmith FDB work?  dittoNext steps:  1. Copy T00,S00 manually with a     sector editor  2. Maybe nothing? (EDD bit copy works     so probably no nibble check)                   ~               Chapter 1 In Which We Find The Least We Can Do[S6,D1=original disk (#1)][S6,D2=partial Locksmith FDB copy][Disk Fixer]  ["O" -> "Input/Output Control"]    set "CHECKSUM ENABLED" to "NO"  ["R"ead track $00, sector $00]  ["C"opy sector to drive 2][S6,D1=Locksmith FDB copy]]PR#6...works...The same procedure works for the other7 disks.I almost didn't write this up, but Ijust love this protection scheme. Theychanged one epilogue byte on the onesector where it's ignored anyway (sinceit's read by the disk controller ROMroutine, which doesn't verify epiloguebytes). So they didn't need to make anychanges to the rest of the disk. It'sliterally the least they could do.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 349------------------EOF------------------
