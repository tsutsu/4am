    <p>"Fractions II: Addition, Subtraction,</p>

    <p>COPYA gives no read errors, but the copy does not work. The copy appears to load DOS from tracks 2, 1, and 0, then displays the BASIC prompt, then swings out as if it's reading a disk catalog and running a file... then reboots.</p>
    <p class="seen">In my experience, programs do not spontaneously reboot unless someone tells them to.</p>
    <p>Despite showing all the symptoms of a standard DOS 3.3 file-based program, neither the DOS 3.3 master disk nor</p>
    <p>Copy ][+ can see any files on the disk.</p>

    <p>Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sector editor, T11,S00 does look like the header of a standard DOS 3.3 disk catalog track.</p>

    <p>However, T11,S0F is all zeroes, which explains why the third-party utilities think there are no files. The thing it does not explain is how the disk, you know, actually works.</p>

TRACK $03  SECTOR $0F   DOS 3.3</code>
    </div>
    <p>So this disk has its catalog split across two tracks. It starts on T11,S00 as usual, which points to T11,S0F as usual, but when it comes time to list the actual files, it knows to look on track 3 instead. But how does the original disk know that? I scoured "Beneath Apple DOS" until I found the answer on page 8-28:</p>
    <div class="curses">
      <code>B011-B036 Read a directory sector
; (If CARRY flag is zero on entry, read
  first directory sector. If CARRY is
  one, read next)
; Memorize entry code.
; Set buffer pointers (B045).
; First or next?
; If first, get track/sector of
  directory sector from VTOC at offset
  +1,+2.
; Otherwise, get track/sector from
  directory sector at offset +1,+2. If
  track is zero, exit with error code
  (end of directory).
; Call RWTS to read sector.
; Exit with normal return code.</code>
    </div>
    <p class="seen">So, to read the first sector of file names and other metadata, this routine is supposed to look at the VTOC sector buffer (read from T11,S00 and stored at $B3BB..$B4BA). The VTOC says "hey, the first sector of files and stuff is in T11,S0F" so this routine is supposed to read T11,S0F.</p>
    <p class="seen">But the DOS on this disk made one small modification to that routine. (This is stored on T01,S0F.)</p>

    <p class="seen">Instead of getting the track number from the VTOC, it hard-codes track 3.</p>
    <p class="seen">Now that I've identified the problem, the fix is straightforward. If I change the VTOC header (T11,S00) to point to the actual first directory sector (T03,S0F), DOS 3.3 or any other copy utility should be able to read the entire catalog. DOS 3.3 is certainly flexible enough to handle this. Storing the entire VTOC on track $11 is just a convention; DOS doesn't actually care where directory sectors are stored as long as it can find the next one.</p>
    <p class="seen">T11,S00,$01 change "11" to "03"</p>
    <p>Lo and behold, Copy ][+ can suddenly see all the files on the disk.</p>
    <p>Switching back to the sector editor, T01,S09 says the autorun program is named HELLO4. My non-working copy sounded like it got that far, so let's take a look at HELLO4.</p>

    <p>Nice. They're using some modified DOS that stores date stamps at the end of filenames. Unfortunately, this probably means I can't just replace the DOS on the disk with a standard DOS, since it would think that the date stamps were part of the filenames and wouldn't be able to load anything. If there are any patches to be made to this DOS, I'll need to make them in place.</p>

    <p>Aha! It's not an infinite loop after all. Well, it is, technically, but it won't actually run forever. It's not easy to show in plain text, but the initial "D" and the final "M" are in inverse. So that string starts with</p>
    <p>Ctrl-D and ends with Ctrl-M. Since DOS is already loaded, printing this through the DOS vector will execute that command, as if you typed it from a prompt yourself. Since that program never returns to the caller, it will break out of the seemingly "infinite" loop.</p>
    <p>This entire program is superfluous. The only thing it does is a nibble check (which I don't want to do) and execute the real startup program, ESI.STARTUP.</p>
    <p>Using Copy ][+, I can change the boot program of the disk to ESI.STARTUP. (You can also do this manually by sector-editing T01,S09.)</p>
