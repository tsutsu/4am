-------------Game Frame One------------A 4am crack                  2015-11-16---------------------------------------Name: Game Frame OneGenre: educationalYear: 1986Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Co.Media: 4 single-sided 5.25-inch disksOS: Apple PascalPrevious cracks: noneThe disks are unordered but labeled:  - "Shafts and Stairs"  - "Tug-A-Grug"  - "Smileage"  - "Content Diskette" (not bootable)The first three are bootable and appearto be independent of each other. I'llstart with "Shafts and Stairs."                   ~               Chapter 0 In Which Various Automated Tools Fail          In Interesting WaysCOPYA  no errors, but copy hangs during late  boot, with the drive motor onLocksmith Fast Disk Backup  dittoEDD 4 bit copy (no sync, no count)  dittoCopy ][+ nibble editor  nothing suspiciousDisk Fixer  T00 -> Pascal 1.1 bootloader (strings    at $AC = "MUST BOOT FROM SLOT 6",    at $C1 = "NO FILE SYSTEM.APPLE")  T00,S0B -> Pascal disk catalogWhy didn't my copies work?  probably a nibble check that fails in  an infinite loopThe program appears to be written inApple Pascal. The boot process startswith several sequential disk reads,then clears the screen and displays ablock cursor in the upper-left corner.(I also recognize the hi-res graphicsfont and the way the program draws it.I'll take "Skills I Never Thought I'dUse" for $200, Alex, but here we are.)This is as far as my non-working copygets; the original disk shows the titlescreen shortly thereafter.Next steps:  1. Use the tools on an Apple Pascal     system disk to verify that this     disk really uses Apple Pascal  2. Find the HELLO program (usually     SYSTEM.STARTUP) and decompile it  3. Hack the p-code to disable the     copy protectionBut first, let me try a shortcut.                   ~               Chapter 1      In Which We Try A ShortcutTurning to my trusty sector editor, Ido a quick scan for some common bytepatterns of nibble checks. First,"LDA $C089,X" -- used by virtuallyevery nibble check I've ever seen. (Itturns on the drive motor manually, soyou can read raw nibbles or whatever.)[Disk Fixer]  ["F"ind]    ["H"ex]      "BD 89 C0"Several matches:  T00,S02 - part of a legitimate RWTS  T0E,S0D - ditto  T18,S07 - highly suspicious  T1B,S05 - potentially suspicious                 --v--T18,S07----------- DISASSEMBLY MODE ----------; standard beginning of an external; assembly language routine called from; a Pascal program009E:68             PLA009F:85 00          STA   $0000A1:68             PLA00A2:85 01          STA   $0100A4:68             PLA00A5:68             PLA00A6:68             PLA00A7:68             PLA00A8:68             PLA00A9:AA             TAX00AA:68             PLA; turn on drive motor manually; (always suspicious)00AB:BD 8E C0       LDA   $C08E,X00AE:BD 89 C0       LDA   $C089,X00B1:A9 00          LDA   #$0000B3:85 02          STA   $02; find an $A5 nibble00B5:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B400B8:C8             INY00B9:D0 07          BNE   $00C200BB:E6 02          INC   $0200BD:D0 03          BNE   $00C200BF:4C A5 00       JMP   $00A500C2:C9 A5          CMP   #$A500C4:D0 EF          BNE   $00B5; the next two nibbles are 4-4 encoded; and the final value is stored in $0300C6:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B400C9:38             SEC00CA:2A             ROL00CB:85 04          STA   $0400CD:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B400D0:25 04          AND   $0400D2:85 03          STA   $03; skip next 3 nibbles00D4:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B400D7:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B400DA:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B4; find "D5 AA 96" (address prologue); while counting the number of nibbles; it took to get there (in Y)00DD:A9 10          LDA   #$1000DF:85 05          STA   $0500E1:A0 FD          LDY   #$FD00E3:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B300E6:C9 D5          CMP   #$D500E8:D0 F9          BNE   $00E300EA:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B300ED:C9 AA          CMP   #$AA00EF:D0 F5          BNE   $00E600F1:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B300F4:C9 96          CMP   #$9600F6:D0 EE          BNE   $00E600F8:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B4; several values of Y are acceptable00FB:C0 10          CPY   #$1000FD:F0 0A          BEQ   $010900FF:C0 11          CPY   #$11(code continues on T18,S06)0101:F0 06          BEQ   $01090103:A5 05          LDA   $050105:C9 0B          CMP   #$0B0107:D0 3A          BNE   $0143; now count the number of nibbles; before "D5 AA AD" (data prologue)0109:A0 FE          LDY   #$FE010B:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B3010E:C9 D5          CMP   #$D50110:D0 F9          BNE   $010B0112:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B30115:C9 AA          CMP   #$AA0117:D0 F5          BNE   $010E0119:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B3011C:C9 AD          CMP   #$AD011E:D0 EE          BNE   $010E; only one value is acceptable0120:C0 12          CPY   #$120122:D0 1F          BNE   $0143; skip nibbles until we find an $AA0124:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B40127:C9 AA          CMP   #$AA0129:D0 F9          BNE   $0124012B:20 B4 00       JSR   $00B4012E:C6 05          DEC   $050130:D0 AF          BNE   $FFE1; count the number of nibbles until we; find an $A50132:A0 FF          LDY   #$FF0134:20 B3 00       JSR   $00B30137:C9 A5          CMP   #$A50139:D0 F9          BNE   $0134; needs to match the 4-4 encoded value; we decoded earlier013B:C4 03          CPY   $03013D:D0 04          BNE   $0143; success path falls through to here013F:A9 FF          LDA   #$FF0141:D0 02          BNE   $0145; failure path ends up here0143:A9 00          LDA   #$00; pass return value (in accumulator); back to Pascal code0145:48             PHA0146:48             PHA; turn off drive and prepare to return; to the Pascal interpreter0147:BD 88 C0       LDA   $C088,X014A:A5 01          LDA   $01014C:48             PHA014D:A5 00          LDA   $00014F:48             PHA0150:60             RTS; This is the code at $00B3.
