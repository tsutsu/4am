If it finds a $D5followed by a timing bit, that's it;that's the entire address prologue.Without the timing bit, it looks forthe rest of a standard prologue.Turning back to the Copy ][+ nibbleeditor, I see the crucial detail that Imissed the first time. The "D5" that Ithought was the third nibble in theaddress prologue is actually the first,and it is displayed in inverse, meaningit has timing bits after it. (Sorrythat doesn't show up in text.)The disk does happen to have a 3-nibbleaddress prologue on every sector, butit only uses the one of them (plus atiming bit). Each address field alsohappens to have a consistent epiloguesequence, but the RWTS never checks it.I assume this accidental consistency isa side effect of the mastering process.Why didn't the EDD copy work?  EDD preserved the original address  prologue but not the timing bits.  The prologue checker finds the $D5  (at $B954) but no timing bit after it  (at $B95C), so the disk can't read  itself. There was never any separate  nibble check; the structure of the  disk itself is designed to foil  nibble copiers.Why did the demuffin'd copy work?  Advanced Demuffin wrote out the data  from each sector onto a standard disk  that uses "D5 AA 96" prologue and "DE  AA EB" epilogue. The RWTS finds the  first $D5, doesn't find a timing bit,  but it finds the remaining standard  prologue (AA 96) and decides that it  found a valid address field. Thus, no  RWTS patches are necessary.All 14 disks use the same protection.Quod erat liberandum.                   ~               Chapter 3  In Which We Patch The RWTS Anyway,            And Explain WhyEmulators aren't perfect. Real hardwareis complicated, and the Disk II isespecially difficult to emulate (being,as it is, an analog device). Many edgecases are left as "an exercise for thereader." Many copy protection schemesrely on edge cases to work.You may see where this is going.My crack of this disk works perfectlyon real hardware. It also works in mostApple II emulators that run on modernhardware. But it does not work in everyemulator, so I set out to discover why.Here is the RWTS code from the originaldisk, which I have left untouched thusfar:; find address prologue #1B94F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB952-   10 FB       BPL   $B94FB954-   C9 D5       CMP   #$D5B956-   D0 F0       BNE   $B948; kill 2 CPU cyclesB958-   EA          NOP; read data latch one more timeB959-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,X; if the data latch still has $D5 in it; then we are reading an original disk; which uses a single nibble + timing; bit as the address prologue, so jump; forward to start parsing the address; fieldB95C-   C9 D5       CMP   #$D5B95E-   F0 12       BEQ   $B972; otherwise we are reading a standard; disk (like a data disk -- or, in my; case, a cracked copy), so continue; checking the prologue for the regular; second and third nibblesB960-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB963-   10 FB       BPL   $B960B965-   C9 AA       CMP   #$AAB967-   D0 DF       BNE   $B948B969-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB96C-   10 FB       BPL   $B969B96E-   C9 96       CMP   #$96B970-   D0 D6       BNE   $B948At $B95C, we're checking the data latchto see if it is still holding the $D5value. On real Disk II hardware, thiswill only be true if there was an extratiming bit after the $D5. The timingbit causes the data latch to retain itsvalue for 4 more CPU cycles. This isthe crux of the entire copy protection.Here's the problem: some emulators will(incorrectly) retain the $D5 value inthe data latch for longer than a realdrive would. This makes the RWTS thinkthat it's reading an original disk.Specifically, $B95E (incorrectly)branches to $B972 and tries to startparsing the address field. Of course,on my crack, the address field hasn'tstarted yet -- there are still two morenibbles in the address prologue. Theaddress field checksum fails becausewe're off by two nibbles, disks grind,programs crash, everything is terrible.The solution is tricky, because we'rein the middle of RWTS code so timing istight (even in misbehaving emulators).But if we change the code at $B958 tobranch to $B960, we'll have enough timeto catch the second and third nibblesof the standard address prologue. Thisshould work on real hardware, faithfulemulators, and misbehaving emulators(since we'll never execute the compareat $B95C that went awry).The patched RWTS code:B94F-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,XB952-   10 FB       BPL   $B94FB954-   C9 D5       CMP   #$D5B956-   D0 F0       BNE   $B948B958-   F0 06       BEQ   $B960 ------+B95A-  [8C C0] \                      |B95C-  [C9 D5]  } never executed      |B95E-  [F0 12] /                      |B960-   BD 8C C0    LDA   $C08C,X <---+B963-   10 FB       BPL   $B960B965-   C9 AA       CMP   #$AAB967-   D0 DF       BNE   $B948T00,S03,$58 change "EA BD" to "F0 06"                   ~               Changelog2015-12-21- apply and explain patch for legacy  emulators---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 195------------------EOF------------------
