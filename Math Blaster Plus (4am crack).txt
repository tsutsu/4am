I just figured this out. This isnot the code I'm looking for. This isthe code that interprets the code I'mlooking for. This is an interpreter.Now what?I've had some limited success withreverse engineering Pascal p-code, butthat was  1. painful,  2. only possible because p-code is     well known and meticulously     documented and I already knew     Pascal, and  3. still painfulI don't know any Forth. I've neverused Forth on any computer, 8-bit orotherwise. There were apparentlyseveral different versions of Forth onthe Apple II, but I don't know whichversion this disk uses.Let's regroup.                   ~               Chapter 3   In Which We Regroup, Take Stock,  And Continue From First PrinciplesHere's what I know:  * This disk is copyable with EDD bit    copy, so there is probably no fancy    nibble check that relies on timing    bits or desynchronized nibbles.  * The program runs (from the original    disk) even if I first boot ProDOS    from my hard drive. That's not even    the same version of ProDOS as the    original disk.  * Other disks by this publisher (e.g.    Spell It Plus!, crack no. 201),    have similar disk characteristics    (bad sector on track $22) and    behavior (copies quit via ProDOS    program selector).  * Under ProDOS, "quitting via the    program selector" and "reading a    raw sector" are accomplished by    sending commands to the ProDOS MLI.  * All calls to the ProDOS MLI route    through the same entry point    ($BF00).This gives me an idea. Since I can runthis program even after booting ProDOSfrom my hard drive, maybe I can alsoinstall a little logging program thatlets me see ProDOS MLI calls as theywhiz by.]PR#7]CALL -151*BF00LBF00-   4C 4B BF    JMP   $BF4BOK, at the end of my routine, I'll needto jump to $BF4B to get to the real MLIentry point.; get, print, and store the top address; on the stack0100-   BA          TSX; high byte0101-   BD 02 01    LDA   $0102,X0104-   8D 22 01    STA   $01220107-   20 DA FD    JSR   $FDDA; low byte010A-   BD 01 01    LDA   $0101,X010D-   8D 21 01    STA   $01210110-   20 DA FD    JSR   $FDDA; print a space0113-   A9 A0       LDA   #$A00115-   20 F0 FD    JSR   $FDF0; increment the address we got earlier; (and put in $0121/$0122)0118-   EE 21 01    INC   $0121011B-   D0 03       BNE   $0120011D-   EE 22 01    INC   $0122; this line of code will now load the; MLI command that was passed to the; ProDOS MLI (it's the byte immediately; after the JSR to the MLI entry point)0120-   AD FF FF    LDA   $FFFF; print that too0123-   20 DA FD    JSR   $FDDA; print a carriage return0126-   A9 8D       LDA   #$8D0128-   20 F0 FD    JSR   $FDF0; wait for a key012B-   2C 10 C0    BIT   $C010012E-   AD 00 C0    LDA   $C0000131-   10 FB       BPL   $012E; jump to real MLI0133-   4C 4B BF    JMP   $BF4B*PREFIX /MATH.0*BLOAD MATH.SYSTEM,A$2000,TSYS; route all MLI calls through my logger*BF00:4C 00 01; run the program*2000GI've annotated the following outputwith the name of each MLI command.

I'vestepped through some of the initialcommands already, so they come as nosurprise. I know that it loads threefiles, "MATH.BLASTER", "TK.ABS", and"TEST.FONT". I even know where itswitches to 80-column mode ($18CF).But that's where it gets interesting.After it switches to 80-column mode,every stack address is the same ($0889)except the final QUIT command ($4059).So all of those MLI calls are comingfrom inside the interpreter, presumablysome MLI wrapper function.Also, that READ_BLOCK (command $80) isvery suspicious. That's a raw sectorread (really two sectors, since ProDOSdoes everything by blocks). So, it  1. issues a READ_BLOCK MLI call, then  2. opens/reads/closes a file, then  3. quits at $4053Also, there is a file named "QUIT" onthis disk which loads at $4000. If thatisn't all connected, it would be acoincidence of magnificent proportions.                   ~               Chapter 4         In Which Up Is Down,            Black Is White,        And Failure Is SuccessI have another crazy idea: upgrade mylogger to modify the MLI command on thefly. That is, if the command on entryis $80 (READ_BLOCK), change it tosomething else, like $CC (CLOSE). WhyCLOSE? Because it will always fail. No,really. READ_BLOCK takes 3 parameters;CLOSE takes 1. The first thing the MLIdoes is check whether the parametercount is correct for the given command;if not, it exits immediately withreturn code $02.(And remember, I want the READ_BLOCKcommand to fail. On the original disk,it fails because of the intentionallybad sector on track $22. Failure issuccess.)]PR#7]CALL -151; get the top stack address and put it; in $0116/$01170100-   BA          TSX0101-   BD 02 01    LDA   $0102,X0104-   8D 17 01    STA   $01170107-   BD 01 01    LDA   $0101,X010A-   8D 16 01    STA   $0116; increment the address we got from; the stack (does not touch the stack; itself, just our local copy)010D-   EE 16 01    INC   $01160110-   D0 03       BNE   $01150112-   EE 17 01    INC   $0117; now this instruction will load the; MLI command0115-   AD FF FF    LDA   $FFFF; is it READ_BLOCK?0118-   C9 80       CMP   #$80; no, branch without changing anything011A-   D0 11       BNE   $012D; yes, change the MLI command to CLOSE; by modifying the STA instruction at; $012A011C-   AD 16 01    LDA   $0116011F-   8D 2B 01    STA   $012B0122-   AD 17 01    LDA   $01170125-   8D 2C 01    STA   $012C0128-   A9 CC       LDA   #$CC012A-   8D FF FF    STA   $FFFF; call the real MLI012D-   4C 4B BF    JMP   $BF4B*PREFIX /MATH.0*BLOAD MATH.SYSTEM,A$2000,TSYS; set the trap*BF00:4C 00 01; execute the program*2000G...works, and it is glorious...Now I have a way to get a copy to load.But how should I make this changepermanent? I could install this MLItrap on boot and literally route everyMLI command through it, changing anyREAD_BLOCK commands on the fly. But I'mnot 100% sure that there aren't otherlegitimate uses of READ_BLOCK burieddeep within the program. I'm also not100% sure that the trap won't getoverwritten if the stack gets too big,and I'm not sure where else I could putit in memory that wouldn't ever be usedduring the entire lifetime of theprogram. It all just feels inelegant.It's not a solution; it's a prototype.A real solution would be to find theinterpreted code that calls that MLIfunction wrapper (near $889) with theREAD_BLOCK command and checks for itsexpected failure. Then I can eitherchange the if-then logic, or NOP it outsomehow, or possibly just change thatone READ_BLOCK command to CLOSE. Likemy prototype, but without affectingevery single MLI call and withouttaking up any extra memory.OK, that's what I want to do. Find theinterpreted code that ends up issuingthe READ_BLOCK MLI call, and change theMLI command from $80 to $CC. A one bytepatch.
