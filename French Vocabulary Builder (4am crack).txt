-------French Vocabulary Builder-------A 4am crack                  2014-05-15---------------------------------------"French Vocabulary Builder" is a 1982educational program distributed byControl Data Corporation as part oftheir "Plato Courseware" series.COPYA fails immediately with a diskread error. EDD 4 bit copy appears towork, but the copy just hangs on boot.Turning to my trusty Copy ][+ sectoreditor, I find the "DOS 3.3 PATCHED"option (press "P" to go to the SectorEditor Patcher) allows me to read everysector on every track. Track 0 feelslike a DOS 3.3 RWTS, and I see a VTOCon track $11.Based on my experience with otherdisks, this evidence suggests that thisdisk has- Standard prologue bytes before the  address and data fields [otherwise  Copy ][+ sector editor would give  read errors, even with the "DOS 3.3  PATCHED" option]- Non-standard epilogue bytes after the  address and data fields [otherwise  COPYA would work]- Some secondary protection [otherwise  the bit copy created with EDD 4 would  work]The easiest way to convert the disk tostandard epilogue bytes is to use COPYAwith a patched RWTS that accepts anyepilogue bytes on read but includesstandard epilogue bytes on write.[S6D1=DOS 3.3 master disk]]PR#6...]CALL -151*B942:18*3D0G]RUN COPYA[S6D1=original disk][S6D2=blank disk]...read read read......grind grind grind......write write write...OK, now I have a copy in standard diskformat that can be read by any tools.i.e. I can copy the disk that's indrive 2 with COPYA without patching theRWTS beforehand. I can sector edit thedisk without messing with the SectorEditor Patcher.There are two problems with this copy:1. Depending on how the original disk   was written, this copy may or may   not be able to read itself. I may   need to patch the disk's RWTS to   deal with the fact that the disk is   in a standard format. Or I may be   able to replace the DOS completely.2. Even if it can read itself, it won't   get very far, because it still has   some sort of secondary protection   checking if the disk is original.   (Hint: it's not.)To investigate problem #1, let's see ifI can see any files on the disk.]CATALOG,S6,D2DISK VOLUME 254 A 003 HELLO*B 003 APHANGM.SHAPES B 036 APFRNCH1.OBJ B 023 APFRCHOC.OBJ B 039 APFRPYR1.OBJ B 033 APFRHNG1.OBJ B 029 APFRHNG2.OBJ B 012 APFRLIST.OBJ*B 017 RUNTIME*B 026 APFR.GEN A 002 DISK LAST UPDATED: 10/30/82 B 042 APFRHNG3.OBJ*T 009 APWFRE0*T 009 APWFRE1*T 009 APWFRE2*T 009 APWFRE3*T 009 APWFRE4*T 009 APWFRE5*T 009 APWFRE6*T 009 APWFRE7*T 009 APWFRE8*T 009 APWFRE9My suspicion was correct: this disk hasa standard disk catalog. It even has aHELLO program. That looks inviting.]RUN HELLOSuccess! The program loads and runswithout complaint. That tells me thatwhatever was causing the copy to hangduring boot was confined to the boot.In other words, the copy protection wasentirely contained within the customRWTS and DOS on tracks 0-2 of theoriginal disk. Booting from the DOS 3.3master disk, I was just able to run theprogram -- from drive 2, no less!So, if I'm right, I don't need to worryabout problem #2 at all (the copyprotection routine). To getting a fullyworking copy, all I need to do is tooverwrite the disk's custom DOS with astandard DOS.I usually choose Pronto-DOS by BeagleBros. for this purpose, since it'shighly compatible with DOS 3.3 but muchfaster. I keep a freshly formattedPronto-DOS disk around for preciselythis occasion.Copy ][+  --> COPY    --> DOS      --> from slot 6, drive 2      -->   to slot 6, drive 1[S6D1=my non-working copy][S6D2=newly formatted Pronto-DOS disk]...read read read......write write write...Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                      No. 33-------------------EOF-----------------
