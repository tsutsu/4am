The originaldisk uses disk volume 001, but theprocess of converting it with AdvancedDemuffin gives me a (non-working) copywith disk volume 254. (This is encodedin every sector's address field.)Why is this a problem? Well, besidesappearing in every sector's addressfield, the volume number is stored infour different places when a disk isinitialized:1. $B7EB (T00,S01,$EB), in the RWTS   parameter table used by boot1 to   load DOS from tracks 0-2 ["Beneath   Apple DOS", p. 8-35]2. $B7F6 (T00,S01,$F6), also in the   RWTS parameter table, as the "last   found" disk volume   3. $AA66 (T01,S09,$66), in the parsed   keyword table used by DOS to load   the startup program (and every other   file loaded after that) [ibid.,   p. 8-21]4. $B3C1 (T11,S00,$06), in the VTOC   header [ibid., p. 8-32]My (non-working) copy has a $01 in eachof those locations. Since this doesn'tmatch the actual disk volume number inthe address fields, every sector readfails and DOS never loads. (Why did itwork when I booted from my work disk?Because that loaded DOS from a separatedisk that was already disk volume 254,thus matching up with the actual diskvolume number in my non-working copy'saddress fields.)Using my trusty Disk Fixer sectoreditor, I changed each of theaforementioned locations to $FE.T00,S01,$EB change 01 to FET00,S01,$F6 change 01 to FET01,S09,$66 change 01 to FET11,S06,$06 change 01 to FESuccess! My copy finally boots and runson its own. There doesn't appear to beany further copy protection.(Note to self: add this to a futureversion of Post-Demuffin Patcher.)Disk 2 has identical protection.Quod erat liberandum.---------------------------------------A 4am crack                     No. 246------------------EOF------------------
